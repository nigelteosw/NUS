Using Osu Bill Nye the Science Guy [Easy] - mapped by Monstrata

I would like to test both [[Musical Intelligence]] and [[Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence]]. I would use a rhythm game to test a person’s hand eye coordination, reaction time, and their ability to adapt and learn over time. I think it would  be interesting to determine if there might be a relation between reaction time and intelligence. I also would like to seek to prove if they have the ability to learn to do the activity better in the short period of time by making them run the experiment again.

**Brainstorm questions that can guide you when designing and administering an intelligence test. Describe and reflect on your intelligence test in your learning journal. Consider: what your test really tests, what the results are and what you can conclude. Consider any shortcomings.**
