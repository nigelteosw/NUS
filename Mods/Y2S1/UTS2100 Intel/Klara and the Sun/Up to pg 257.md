Paul does not want to speak to Klara
"Come on, speak to her some more"

Mother hanging on to her job as if it was her world, Josie's world would collapse

Substitutions are not as bad as they seem
- Finally living for the first time

Walking memorial
- relational terms
- identity transplant
- not organic
- going off script of her own goals


Longing/curiosity about her old store 

Father protective of Josie

Same process used with Sal, which may be why it will not work with Josie
Sal is akin to a bereavement doll and 

Mother and Mr. Capaldi had tried to make a version of Sal but with different/less advanced technology that didn't want to be there

Test how well she knew about Josie and how she makes her decisions
- no ethics? just does
- lacking a simple form of judgement
	- simple kind of ethics
	- she wins the reader using a childlike innocence
- Klara being better than Josie

Mother cannot handle losing another daughter

Argument over lifting Josie after what happened to Sal

before he helps her to destroy the machine, Paul explains to Klara why he dislikes Capaldi. He says that Capaldi believes that Josie can be reduced down to something that you can “excavate, copy, [or] transfer”

human heart is complex
nothing unique about a human

fascist leanings?
