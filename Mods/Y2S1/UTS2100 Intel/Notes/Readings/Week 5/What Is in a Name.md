# What Is in a Name? A Historical Review of Intelligence Test Score Labels
**Woods, Floyd, Singh, Layton, Norfolk, Farmer (2018)**

Results indicate a paradigm shift beginning in the 1980s that has slowly resulted in more common, but not universal, use of terminology that focuses on the statistical aspect of scores, rather than employing value-laden and potentially stigmatizing terms.

## Labels and Stigma
Stigma is the “phenomenon whereby an individual with an attribute which is deeply discredited by his/her society is rejected as a result of the attribute” (Goffman, 1963, p. 3)

### Labels for Exceptionality and Intelligence Testing
Idiocy was determined based on subjective judgments about functional skills and social responsiveness, and genius was determined based on accomplishments and perceived contributions to society.

Our findings demonstrate that, consistent with this paradigm shift, labels that utilize stigmatizing language, such as “mental defective” and “inferior,” and diagnostic categories, such as “mentally retarded,” have largely been removed from use.

Labels reflecting privilege or superiority, such as “genius” or “gifted,” have also decreased in frequency over time, with some exceptions.

On the other hand, there is excess and *potentially problematic meaning attached to score labels*, as many are associated with both stigma and privilege. As such, it is important for the field, as well as other fields, to approach such classification systems with caution and *awareness of broader societal implications and outcomes*.
