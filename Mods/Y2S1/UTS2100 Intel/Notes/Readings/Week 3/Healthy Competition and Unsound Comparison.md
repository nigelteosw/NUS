 Healthy competition and unsound comparison: reforming education competition in Singapore#
**Christensen (2014)**

He argues that while the current wave of education reforms emphasizes **standardisation, accountability and competition**, what is required from education systems in order to sustain economic competitiveness is rather the ability to nurture qualities like flexibility, creativity and risk-taking (Sahlberg 2006, 275)

Education system in a new knowledge economy, reduce emphasis on test results. 21st century competencies.

Three main parts:
1) In the years following independence, competition was turned into a linchpin of national identity in Singapore and, specifically, how it was enshrined in the national ideology of ‘meritocracy’ that still provides the dominant framework for conceptions of social and educational justice in Singapore.
2) How the relationship between academic competition and educational excellence have changed decisively as a result of the advent of a ‘knowledge economy’ model of education
3) Recent education reform seems to give rise to a highly ambivalent conception of educational competition

### Competition for survival ###
Surviving after independence, big fish eat small fish. Individualistic mentality. 

Used to justify egalitarianism, idea that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or moral status.
Differing aspect is how much work 1 puts in.
Over time education was developed into the main vehicle for this elitist system of meritocratic selection.
- PSLE

Streamed into different pathways from a very early age.
A lot of its success based on high stakes examinations.
- Parents want to secure the advantage for their kids
- Even though we have high standards, its not based on the pursuit of learning, but to be able to beat the exams


**Comparison vs Competition**
Market competition for Singapore as a small country
Contrasted against the west where students develop at their own pace.
Changed his mind: now required a passion for learning

The very intensity of academic competition which he had celebrated in his 1992 speech as detrimental to the kind of learning needed to sustain a world-class education system.

"In a knowledge economy, intellectual capital is the nation’s wealth. But intellectual capital is not just about a person’s mental or intellectual capability. It also embodies other equally important aspects that make up a whole person"

Require to develop diverse talents, abilities and interests of individual students.

### Education reform: from academic to holistic competition?###
**Paradox:** Official education policy has persistently centered on lighter curricula and less emphasis on examinations, this is not reflected in public perceptions of the education system.

Important to reeducate parents.

**Symbolic Competition vs Imaginary Competition**
Symbolic, static and quantifiable.

Imaginary competition starts when parents wants their children to get into a better school (assigning of norms)
Parents have willed this kind of competition into existence.

Leave untouched the idea of symbolic competition. All the structures still remain unchanged, and something systemic needs to be changed.

Removal of others grades. Resulting in no transparency. 

**Meritocracy without competition?**
Parents deprived of info.
Competitive aspects are being more unclear, what does it mean to be more successful.
Activities become more high stakes, using DSA (another way to manifest the competitiveness within parents)

Rapidly increasing socio-economic disparities among Singaporeans

**Conclusion**
Creativity will not flourish and be sustained in schools unless people feel secure to take risks and explore the unknown. Moreover, working with and understanding innovations require creative and risk-intensive contexts.

We see results because we think that excellence cannot be achieved without pressure and stress.
