# Youth mobilities in elite schools: elite circuit, reflexive youth biographies and their mobility blips
**Aaron Koh (2018)**

The expansion of higher education has led to a graduate glut where many graduates are chasing after limited jobs in the labor market.
- Therefore, class matters in the bid for a better feel for the game of graduate recruitment.

### Elite circuit, youth agency and “structured improvisations”: a contextual theorizing.
This paper contributes to the youth agency debate by introducing *“elite circuit”* – the embodiment of class structure – to make the argument that youth agency is not free from structural constraints and that some have access to more resources than others


### Mobility blips: a discussion
“regulated improvisations”
improvise and develop a more “permeable habitus” to blend in with the “Others”.


### Conclusion
My point is attending an elite school is no guarantee to an elite destination; it takes more to succeed than just attending an elite school.
- these students can route and re-route themselves because their family capital and privilege class background enables them to mobilize the resources when required to help them navigate alternate pathways towards success.
- class advantage is a useful resource that can come in useful to overcome the impending structures and obstacles in life.

Despite the advantage and privilege of being in an elite circuit, their post school life pathways are just as fragile and fallible
- A broader perspective about education could be taken up to teach them that success in life takes *grit, resilience and tenacity* to overcome the many challenges that life will definitely present itself.
