# This is What Inequality Looks Like (Chapter 6)
**Teo You Yenn (2018)**


“Teo's main argument revolves a research gap in how meritocracy is perceived. There is more emphasis in the impression and belief of meritocracy rather than the idea of the meritocracy itself. The main argument is that within society, there already exists a bias of the different ethnic minorities which defeats the purpose of a fair and merit-rewarding society. The consequences if this issues are not discussed is the normalisation of inferiorising practices and social exclusion, which will make it harder to bring up such issues in the future.”


The state intervenes deeply in regulation the channels of provision and routes to access.
- Employment income as the primary mode for meeting needs
	- Self reliance


### Institutionalization
"help the needy and their families achieve self-reliance"
"encourage families to be the first line of support for the needy"
"spur community organizations to participant in helping the needy under 'Many Helping Hands' approach"

- Policies aimed to ensure that no one gets more than what the state has designated as their 'need'
- Those needy not applying for help 
	- Applying is difficult
	- Leaving the help for others as they insist they can still manage
		- *Sense of pride?*

People are compelled to fulfill their needs for housing, healthcare and retirement

Ethics are created from collective practices


### Differentiated Deservedness



### Reforms
Strong focus on jobs
- incentivizing employers to retain workers 
Expansion of schemes directed at the low-income
- short term cash aid and subsidies

1. Raised income taxes continues to insert itself into state-led discussions of welfare. Avoidance of direct discussion of inequality and the need for not merely inclusion but redistribution
2. Strong commitment to the means tests in the schemes of subsidies for children's education and care
3. Ghettoization of the problem of poverty. The way of framing the public interventions as charity about those with more helping those with less. Makes it seem like recipients as recipients rather than members of society with rights to basic levels of well-being and security.


### Now what?
Inequality is not alleviated but depend by state policies.
State policies are discriminating. Some people are more deserving and others less so.

Cannot remain customers?
Only thinking about their own needs.
