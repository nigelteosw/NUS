# Wired that way: genes do shape behaviors but itâ€™s complicated#
**Mitchell (2018)**

But exactly how does our genetic heritage influence our psychological traits?
Genetic variants that cause differences in intelligence.

Intelligence, for example, is not linked to any localised brain parameter. It correlates instead with overall brain size and with global parameters of white matter connectivity and the efficiency of brain networks.
The **sum of the parts of the brain.**

What all this means is that we should not expect the discovery of genetic variants affecting a given psychological trait to directly highlight the hypothetical molecular underpinnings of the affected cognitive functions.
Neural underpinnings vs molecular underpinnings.
