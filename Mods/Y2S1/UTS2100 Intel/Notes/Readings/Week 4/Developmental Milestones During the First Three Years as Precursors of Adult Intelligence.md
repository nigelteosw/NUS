# Developmental Milestones During the First Three Years as Precursors of Adult Intelligence #
**Flensborg-Madsen, T., & Mortensen, E. L. (2018)**

A growing literature suggests that positive associations exist between *faster attainment of infant developmental milestones within the first year of life* and *intellectual function* in childhood.

Low-level motor skills to be correlated to future performance. 

### Significance
Empirical evidence would have implications not only for theoretical understanding of development, but potentially also for child rearing practices and design of interventions to stimulate development.

Missing data from parents:
Well-functioning parents tend to participate in the follow-ups and report data on the milestone attainment of their child

**As a diagnostic**
Developmental screening is suggested to be an integrated part of child health assessments. 
- To check if the child is doing well, not suffering from some underlying condition,
- Not only to pick out which child is developing faster than his/her peers.

### Discussion###
Results indicated milestones related to standing and walking primarily show a direct association with adult intelligence and are to a smaller extent mediated by milestones reflecting development during the subsequent years, in particular language development.

### Methodological Issues###
**The frequency of missing data tended to be high**, especially for milestones related to walking that were not attained by some children at the time of the 1-year follow-up and therefore not recorded.

Associations between early development and adult intelligence may still reflect common environmental or genetic factors.

### Conclusions###
Early attainment of several milestones, primarily those related to motor and language development, was associated with higher intelligence in young adulthood.

Findings suggest that substantially delayed motor and language development may be a cause of concern
