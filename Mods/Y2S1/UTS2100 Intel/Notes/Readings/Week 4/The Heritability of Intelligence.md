# The Heritability of Intelligence: Not What You Think#
**Kaufman (2013)**

### Traditional###
1) Fluid
	- reflect novel, on-the-spot reasoning
2) Crystalized
	- reflect previously acquired knowledge and skills

First, in samples of both adults and children, they found that **the greater the cultural load, the greater the test was associated with IQ:**

Second, in adults, the researchers found that the higher **the heritability of the cognitive test, the more the test depended on culture.** The effects were medium-to-large, and statistically significant:

Best explanation:
Those with the proclivity to engage in cognitive complexity will tend to seek out intellectually demanding environments. Societal demands influence the development and interaction of multiple cognitive abilities and knowledge.

### Idea: Society's Impact on Intelligence###
Cultural loading vs cultural bias.
If society strengthens the demand on abstract reasoning and visuospatial abilities, for example, I would expect an increase in those abilities.
