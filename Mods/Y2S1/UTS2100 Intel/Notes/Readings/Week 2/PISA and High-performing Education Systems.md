# PISA and high-performing education systems: explaining Singapore’s education success #
**Deng and Gopinathan’s (2016)**

- This article offers an alternative explanation for the education success of Singapore.
- The article provides a brief historical account of the development of the education system and then a body of empirical findings on the nature of pedagogical practice in classrooms, both of which are vital for understanding the educational performance of the Singapore system. 
- This is followed by a critical discussion of the basic assertions of the HPES literature and, in particular, the use of PISA results as the prime indicator of the quality of educational performance in a school system.

### Teacher quality ###
- effective initial teacher education and continuing professional development

### School leadership ###
- belief that high-quality school leaders can strengthen the quality of classroom teaching.
- School leaders are expected to be instructional leaders, practising distributed leadership and being able to provide teachers with guidance and support in curriculum and instruction.

### System characteristics ###
- academic expectations, standards, accountability measures
- socio-economic status (SES) seems to have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students

### Educational reform ###

## History of Singapore's Education ##
### Policies ###
1. There is a recognition of the necessity and value of English as an international language to Singapore
2. The government mandated and implemented a uniform and common curriculum (taught in English) to replace the Chinese-based, Malay-based and English-based curricula in the old system. 
3. Introduction of civics and citizenship education to help understand the purpose and importance of nation building
4. A firm commitment to meritocracy

The secret of Singapore’s top rankings, therefore, can be seen as the contingency of traditional pedagogical practice within the context of a centralised education system, with a standardised national curriculum and educational standards enforced by high-stakes examinations and supported by an examination-based meritocracy ideology.

### Paradox ###
- The Asian education model is largely conservative, directed towards the transmission of predetermined content and skills and examination performance
- Asian countries like Singapore and China have well recognised these limitations inherent in their education systems and have embarked on radical curriculum and pedagogical reforms

### PISA ###
- tests competencies related to solving academic types of problems

## Conclusions ##
In other words, policy borrowing requires an understanding of the social, cultural and institutional contexts of the borrowed system, and of the practice or inner workings of schooling informed by evidence and research.

Use of PISA as a chief yardstick may narrow the function or purpose of eduction.

The primary goal of education underpinning PISA is economic – developing skills and competencies for the economy in the twenty-first century.
In context of the education, purely to serve an economic function.
**What other goals are for education?**

Other goals for social cohesion, citizenship education and nation building – goals that are at least as important as the economic one.

The exclusive, one-dimensional focus of PISA on the economic function of schooling prohibits an accurate, realistic representation of what constitutes the educational performance or achievement of a school system.

### Thoughts ###
- Singapore’s education system (built on her historical and cultural contexts) is targeted towards developing skills to built a society targeting economic growth, which coincidentally are what PISA prioritises in testing for (mathematics, science, reading comprehension)

-  “Primary goal of education underpinning PISA is economic - developing skills and competencies for the economy in the twenty-first century”
  
-   “We seek to nurture the whole child and develop them into lifelong learners, with an enduring core of competencies to thrive in the twenty-first century.”  - MOE

- Despite the Asian education model being largely conservative, directed towards the transmission of predetermined content and skills and examination performance, why does Singapore still do well in PISA tests?
