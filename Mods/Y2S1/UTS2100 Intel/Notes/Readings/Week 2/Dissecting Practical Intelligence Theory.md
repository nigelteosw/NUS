# Dissecting practical intelligence theory: Its claims and evidence #
**Gottfredson’s (2003)**

There exists a general factor of practical intelligence that is distinct from ‘‘academic intelligence’

Proponents state that arguably, practical intelligence is a better predictor of success.

Practical Intelligence
- analytical (academic)
	- solve problems (internal world)
- creative
	- experiential information processing (experience)
- practical
	- make solutions to real world problems (external world)

"much of the knowledge needed to succeed in real-world tasks is tacit,’’ making it ‘‘an important factor underlying the successful performance of real-world tasks’

Practical intelligence is shrinking g’s (academic intelligence) apparent causal power by arguing that it represents only a particular domain of knowledge, or learned expertise, rather than a stable, genetically rooted capacity (a trait) for learning and applying knowledge.


The massive evidence from many decades of research that reveals academic inteligence to be a highly general mental ability with strong genetic roots that distinguishes among us in socially important ways

Previous study was limited in using small samples of brighter-than-average workers whose differences in ‘‘knowing the ropes’’ in their mostly high-level jobs help predict how well they perform their jobs or get ahead in them.

**Research papers are not immune to biasness**
They do so partly by appealing to many people’s strong desire to believe them, specifically, by tapping the popular preference for an egalitarian plurality of intelligences (everyone can be smart in some way) and a distaste for being assessed, labeled, and sorted by inscrutable mental tests.

We are highly persuaded because it is a research paper.
