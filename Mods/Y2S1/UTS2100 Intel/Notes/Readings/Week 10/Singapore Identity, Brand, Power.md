# Singapore: Identity, Brand, Power
**Tan (2018)**

## Democratic Mandate
- Lacking in electoral competitiveness
- Group Representation Constituency (GRC)
	- GRCs must include at least one member of parliament (MP) from a designated minority community
	- Opposition parties find it harder to field competent candidates
	- GRCs also allow the PAP to field inexperienced and weaker candidates in teams anchored by more experienced ministerial incumbents, thus enabling the former to be more easily shepherded into parliament
- Psychology professor David Chan (2017: 73–4) cautioned against ‘harmful cynicism’ towards political leaders that could arise when they ignore citizens’ doubts and suppress their questions


## Performance Legitimacy

### External Security
- Foreign policy
- Singapore’s military expenditure (between 3 and 5 per cent of its GDP each year) was the seventh-highest among countries in Asia and Oceania

### Internal Security
- The CMIO model presents the government with a means of securing political legitimation by divide-and-rule; that is to say, maintaining a divided social structure that gives rise to anxiety, fear, and paranoia
- This culture of anxiety, nourished by a constant flow of public communications surrounding internal and external threats, amplifies the Singaporean sense of vulnerability

### Economic Growth
- Singaporeans have now, more than ever, become sensitive also to the government’s shortcomings
- inequality has become a significant problem
- On top of all this, Singaporeans work the longest hours in the world, are the most sleep deprived, and display the highest rate of depression in Asia


## Moral Authority

### Survival and permanent vulnerability
- The government’s moral authority is articulated through its public rhetoric
- Voting for political alternatives, for instance, would be in this view an unnecessary risk that only established democracies can more easily afford.

### Integrity
- Singapore’s anti-corruption strategy
	- Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), that is reasonably well-resourced and that reports to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO)

### Meritocracy
- often sounding very much like a form of ‘selectocracy’
- the government says it needs its most talented people to go into public service and leadership, and its rigorously meritocratic institutions

### Pragmatism
- The ability to combine ‘capitalist’ and ‘socialist’ values in meritocracy
- deconstruct these moralities and ideologies and to deploy their fragments as useful ideational resources that can be combined and repurposed for social, political, and even economic ends.
- the PAP government has very little patience for philosophy, theory, or finely nuanced and elaborate arguments that circulate in academia
	- believing that for every conceivable problem there is already a solution somewhere in the wider world to be studied and intelligently adapted to local circumstances
- the government takes a realist perspective on human nature, accepting what it considers to be its immutable qualities
	- works rationally and strategically around these qualities as parameters rather than try to transform them
- the pragmatic government has had *little patience for intangible, even qualitative, values in its materialist world,* unable to fully appreciate such things as metaphysical, aesthetic, sentimental, cultural, heritage, spiritual, and other aspects of life that do not readily enter into *cost–benefit analysis*
- become more managerial in its orientation to leadership, better able to *build on its techniques of organizing resources* for efficient and effective outcomes, rather than *engaging, inspiring, and transforming* its people

### The Singapore Story
- A conservative national narrative that assembles as official history the founding myths and ideologies of survivalism, good governance, and their concomitant discourses of permanent vulnerability, integrity, meritocracy, and pragmatism
- This victor’s version of history entrenches the political centrality of the PAP government,


## Thoughts 
Securing of hegemony of Singapore means the consolidation of power within one ruling party. Tan tries to use each faucet of government policy and turns it to a mental exercise of how they maintain power.
