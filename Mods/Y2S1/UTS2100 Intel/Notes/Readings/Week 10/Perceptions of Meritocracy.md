# Perceptions of Meritocracy in Singapore: Inconsistencies, Contestations and Biases
**Terri-Anne Teo (2019)**

Rather than identifying whether meritocracy quantitatively exists, this study delves into *how it is perceived*.
- Compared to scholarly critiques of meritocracy as a political tool, there is comparatively less research that investigates how Singaporeans receive and understand meritocracy as a narrative and policy framework
- discourse of power
	- coercion and consensus are key to the maintenance of power rather than force or repression alone


## Meritocracy and Socioeconomic Mobility in Singapore
- meritocracy is a cornerstone of national identity
- Where “merit” is normatively defined as “the preferred view of the good society”
- Representing the state’s endorsement of structural fairness


## Multiracialism
- difference-blind approach assumes a level playing field to begin with, neglecting social disadvantages that are already at play
	- this is what inequality looks like
	- unfair advantages from the beginning
	  
- state as an official language that mitigates systemic ethnic discrimination within institutions and enhances multiracialism by providing a means of inter-group communication
- the disadvantaged and the disenchanted learn to articulate online their condition in ways the official discourse of meritocracy has excluded


## Dislocation: Meritocracy as a Value and Practice
- imply a gap between gap between the valorisation of meritocracy and the belief it exists in practice
- *perceptions of cultural stereotypes* demonstrate cracks in the logics of multiracialism and meritocracy, their damaging effects on ethnic minorities, and how the onus placed on individual responsibility suggests a *lack of societal consciousness*.

### Cultural stereotypes and meritocracy
- perceptions that cultural stereotypes affect how merit is rewarded in schools and workplaces
	- Malays being lazy and Indians being verbose

### A natural bias
- privileged subjects are absolved of the responsibility for redress as they see preferential treatment on the basis of ethnicity as a natural outcome in Singaporean society
	- Hiring practices (prefer Chinese)
	- valorisation of Mandarin as a language of high economic value and “cultural potential” occurs at the detriment of other ethnolinguistic groups who cannot benefit in the same way
	- "Chinese privilege"
	- *Solution:* While recognizing that subjects of privilege do not usually see themselves as such, and even less as oppressors of marginalized groups, it is only acknowledging an “unearned skin privilege” that makes systemic change possible.

- Perceptions of Malay–Muslim discrimination as a natural bias similarly illustrate how cultural stereotypes and policy operate within a feedback loop.


## Conclusion
while meritocracy is generally perceived as a positive value, it is seen as *functioning unevenly* across groups and in *less ideal ways for ethnic minorities*, particularly within employment practices in the private sector.

There will be dire consequences should meritocracy continue to disguise the prevalence of ethnic discrimination.
- internalise inferiorising practices and social exclusion
- belief that unequal treatment is “natural” or “normal” is troubling as it suggests an abstraction from the harms of unwarranted discrimination
	- Normalizing it is bad
- attribution of responsibility has to first be acknowledged as one based on what individuals themselves do, as well as what they fail to prevent as a community

## Thoughts
Teo's main argument revolves a research gap in how meritocracy is perceived. There is more emphasis in the impression and belief of meritocracy rather than the idea of the meritocracy itself. The main argument is that within society, there already exists a bias of the different ethnic minorities which defeats the purpose of a fair and merit-rewarding society. The consequences if this issues are not discussed is the normalisation of inferiorising practices and social exclusion, which will make it harder to bring up such issues in the future.
