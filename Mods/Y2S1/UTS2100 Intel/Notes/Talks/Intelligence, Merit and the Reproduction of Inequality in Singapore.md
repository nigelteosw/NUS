# Intelligence, Merit and the Reproduction of Inequality in Singapore
**Nathan Peng, SMU Political Science**

Structure, Systems and Policy
- Merit and Intelligence are social constructs and hard to measure
- Merit can be purchased
- Early intervention literature warns us of the importance of familial factors
	- Inequality begins at birth and snowballs through *bias and self defeating policies*
- Singapore's system of meritocracy serves to narrow the gap of inequality
- Trying to account for unequal starting points

### Assumptions
- Multiple kinds of intelligence exist
- Cultural/language biased
- All roles in society requires a myriad of intelligence
- Need to account for context in understanding Singapore's success store and the role in our education system


### Meritocracy
- Definition is so wrong
- The people who are the most educated govern
- Popularized meritocracy
	- Michael Young
	- Merit = Intelligence + Effort
	- How to define merit? And for what?
	- They meant their works as warnings
		- Satire book meant as a warning
	- Economic political social benefits
		- Those who are at the bottom rungs of society are unable to attain such benefits

**Why can't we define merit in terms of outcomes?**
- Early Singapore education story
	- By the time they show merit, the past has already affected how merit is shown
- Merit cannot be measured definitively.
	- How do we weigh one against the other

**Who defines merit?**
Winners in the meritocratic systems entrench themselves by defining merit
- Cannot ensure that winners will act to benefit society's interested even with the promise of greater reward

Problem of "time-two meritocracy" how do we get winners not to pass on their advantage to those associated with them
- Unequal starting points are a real and pressing issue

Blaming the individual and moral deservingness
- "the poor are poor because of poor choices"
- Because they did not achieve success, it is their fault that they did not work hard.
	- Blaming the victim


### Intelligence in Singapore
**Nature or nurture?**
- Essentialist vs non-essentialist beliefs
	- Deep hidden and unchanging properties that make people who they are
	- Five dimensions
	- Degree of essentialism
- Malleability of intelligence
	- Fixed vs growth
	- Individual effort will do nothing to improve your intelligence?


### Warnings from early childhood development literature
1. Early inequality produces inequality in ability, achievement, health, and success as adults. (Heckman 2018)
2. Material deprivation has direct long term consequences on the child
	1. poorer immunity cognitive function (Nelson 2000)
3. Learning gap
	1. Lower income parents are generally time poor (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013)
4. Children responds to expectations
	1. Rosenthal 1968 - Bias matters: higher gains in measured intelligence if teachers told students predicted to be 'special'
	2. Pygmalion Effect (self-fulfilling prophecies)
	3. Parents also believe in this
	4. Early disadvantage snowballs over time
5. Parental Stress Matters
	1. Lower income parents face more stress -> harsher parenting 
	2. Positive parenting protects children from negative effects from environmental stress (Brown at al 2020)
	3. Toxic stress which disrupts the development of brain architecture 
6. Disadvantage starts from birth and can be transmitted across generations
	1. Epigenetics
	2. A pregnant woman's environment and behaviors during pregnancy


**Education Gap**
Generally increased over time
If the kid needs help, they can get the help


### PISA
- Singapore students 4th most likely to perform worse due to ESCS disadvantage
- Not gonna jump too far ahead, but not gonna fall behind so much
- Lower income felt a lower sense of belonging to Singapore


### Singapore Education System and Inequality
- Pres schools is where it all starts to diverge
- "Every school is a good school"
	- Teachers are randomized
	- Legacy from parents or older siblings
	- Move house for kids to get into a better school
		- Volunteering
	- No social mixing
- Negative psychological impacts on those that are in gifted

**Strengths and Weaknesses of the Singapore System**
- 7 is too late an age to start sorting people
- Start helping children from the beginning
- Social mobility for that era is different from personal circumstances


**Pragmatic meritocracy:**
- One recognizes the need to equalize outcomes and not just opportunities to correct for structural inequalities

### QnA
Parents are the problem. SAP school. Schooled in their culture to preserve their culture. People make a living keeping cultures alive. 

**Is inequality always bad?**
- Inequality is not a problem if people are able to live decently
- Better off classes are part of the solution
- China
	- All equally poor and starving
- "trickle down" has never worked

- Earlier government intervention exacerbates the problem of inequality

**Challenges of Policymaking**
- Skepticism
	- People believe in a scenario and they slap a story on it
	- Convincing people
- Key stakeholders that need to be engaged:
	- Took into account those who tried
	- Engage those that did something different and failed
	- Do not backstab the stakeholders
- Narrow definitions of merit
	- Whatever you define, people are going to hone kids to fit into those gates
	- Social hierarchy of wages
	- Wages are taken as a reflection of social worth
	- social worth does not define wages
- Culture reproduced by people


Government restricting gifted classes in Taiwan.
Equality of outcomes.
Once economic growth slows down, natural equalization effect is not there
Social network, social wealth.
