### Elderly Care
- Is this a skill
- Can get better at it through practice
- Involves values like patience (is patience a skill?)
	- Certain quality traits we are born with
	- Patience/care can be learnt and trained over time
	- Domestic space -> space that is not private which changes its character

**Historically in Singapore**
- Answer was no in the past
- Used to think that elder care is something that can be developed over time naturally instead of trained for improvement

- Boom of eldercare skills training in 2017
- Going beyond the idea that the level of "care" is limited to the nationality of the migrant worker
- Racial stereotypes for related to skill and ethnicity and race 


### When something is not a skill
- Often underpaid, undervalue, assumption that anyone can do it
- demand of and supply of the job markets
	- state intervention and how the state views the types of skills
- Can be poorly done and inconsistent (no basic standards put into place)

**"Cleansing" care**
- recruit part-time workers
- Change view of care as dirty or demeaning
	- Marketing it differently, about companionship...
	- Self care modules
	- Split one job into three to simplify what eldercare is
- Target: Singaporean retirees. housewives

- Training for respite care
	- temporary help when families are away
	- cleaning, bathing, feeding
- Target: Low income Singaporean women

**"Sieving out" competent care**
- Training about raising standards
- Maid going beyond maids
- Target: Increasingly, women from Myanmar

Job scope of being a domestic helper changed -> a nurses job
- Better skilled, better paid
- Passing on the workload down to the domestic helpers

*Still a woman's job to be the caregiver*
- What about male retirees
- Class dynamics come into play (why low income?)

**Training talent to be exportable**
- manpower pool of domestic help is shrinking
- demand in other countries is increasing as well
	- draw/pull (permanent residency)
- Using ethnic argument to sell labour

Reproducible skill and transferable skill, if people are smart anyone who is smart can do it.
Locals and foreigners should be paid the same.
