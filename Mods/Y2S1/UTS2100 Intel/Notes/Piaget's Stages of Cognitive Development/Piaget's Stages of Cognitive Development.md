Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development suggests that children move through four different stages of learning. His theory focuses not only on understanding how children acquire knowledge, but also on understanding the nature of intelligence.1 Piaget's stages are:

-   **Sensorimotor stage**: Birth to 2 years
-   **Preoperational stage**: Ages 2 to 7
-   **Concrete operational stage**: Ages 7 to 11
-   **Formal operational stage**: Ages 12 and up

Piaget believed that children take an active role in the learning process, acting much like little scientists as they perform experiments, make observations, and learn about the world. As kids interact with the world around them, they continually add new knowledge, build upon existing knowledge, and adapt previously held ideas to accommodate new information.
