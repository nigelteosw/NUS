Reason for why we have a hypothesis? Review prior literature then say what they have not covered and build on that current knowledge.

Look for a gap or extension in the literature. 

Motivated by prior work done before.

Justification of the problem rather than finding a basis for the problem.

Meyer's theory of intelligence.

Self perception on performance. Ability to introspect and reflect on past actions

## Important Questions to Ask
1) Describe one intelligence theory that has challenged the position on intelligence you stated in Week 1.
2) To what extent are IQ tests problematic? Describe one positive and one negative use of IQ tests, providing reasons for your classification.
3) Why might we consider IQ tests historical artefacts?
4) To what extent do you find Gardner's use of "signs" as evidence for multiple intelligences convincing? Provide reasons.
5) Briefly describe two intelligence theories other than multiple intelligences. Which of the theories do you find convincing and why?
6) Why do you think Singapore's education system is so successful in international rankings like PISA? Do you think performance on these metrics is an accurate measure of success?
7) What are the two main types of competition in Singapore's education system according to Christensen? What is the difference between them?
8) Why, in your opinion, is early childhood important (or not) for intelligence development? Cite some evidence for your view.
9) Do you think "cultural loading" (Kan et al., 2013) is a useful concept? Why do you think it is important for intelligence theory (or not)?
10) Describe a key takeaway for you from the first four weeks of seminars.



## [[The Heritability of Intelligence]]
Linguistic items are highly correlated with IQ scores across cultures. Just an interesting effect other than to say communicate. Communication is more complex than we deem it to be. How linguistically smart someone is.

Trying to find a flaw in IQ tests. How much the test is influenced by culture. Not a critique of IQ test being specific to culture. But a critique of how the items in a test are simply just a test of language.

Making a case for culture in understanding the relationship between genes, environment and intelligence.


**Measures of Scientific Rigor**
- Have multiple people looking at the data set.
- All science is biased, sciences can actually be social and random. Objectiveness is deeply flawed.
	- Social nature of science
- The metrics of science shifts just like everything else, past and future changes of the focus of science.
