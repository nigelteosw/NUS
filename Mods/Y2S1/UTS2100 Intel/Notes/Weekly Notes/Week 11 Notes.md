## [[Perceptions of Meritocracy]]
Slippage in the way meritocracy is used.

Even though the ideal system is supposed to be equal at all. If we don't acknowledge the inequalities, things become normalized and it becomes harder to bridge the inequality gap.

Meritocracy achieved by citizens as well as state.

Idea of cultural stereotypes.
- Malays lazy?

Uncomfortable about the article?
- Maybe inequality is inevitable
- People you interact with will influence you or provide you with opportunities which will lead you down through different paths


Affirmative action
- Giving minorities priorities on school entry

What the data seems to be pointing at is there seems to be a deviance between actual vs perceived meritocracy

## [[This is What Inequality Looks Like (Chapter 6)]]

### Differentiated Deservedness

**Differentiated**
Your level of need is differentiated and this dictates the level of need that you need.
It is also benefits, not only help.
Categories are important, if you're not part of this group then 

**Deservedness**
Being in a family unit that is normal.
Not being an undesirable in the eyes of the state.
Being employed.

To deserve, you need to show that you are doing your part, that you contribute to society.

Individuals where their life position counts, make it harder to get opportunities from the institutions. 
You are in it to get whatever benefits or resources that you can. Cannot see the big picture as a customer, only concerned about getting their own needs met.

Can the average Singaporean think about ideas of distribution and public good.


The differentiated in differentiated deservedness refers to being placed in a category where a certain level of help or benefit is awarded to you. People are deserving based on the notion that they are doing their part for society in three broad areas, namely being in a family unit that is NORMAL, not being an UNDESIRABLE in the eyes of the state and being EMPLOYED.

  

It comes into being due to scarcity; not everyone can be afforded the same level of help. Hence, there needs to be a way to allocate the scarce resources such that those who really need it receive more help, i.e. equity. The use of categories as the means of resource distribution is effective but limited.  

  

Differentiated deservedness is a regressive scheme where individuals (in more fortunate categories) enjoy benefits which compound and conversely, individuals who slip through the cracks face an uphill battle. Inequality as a result of capitalist logic and background (circumstances beyond one’s choice e.g. family) is institutionalised. Policy needs to be nuanced. 

  

The nature of state policies being differentiating entrenches the ideology that some people are more deserving and others less so. This has repercussions on the social fabric - renders social reforms targeting inequality less likely to occur due to the individualised nature of the rat race.

  
‘Intelligence’ can be viewed as one such category. The education system is the mechanism by which human capital is filtered into different levels of intelligence through standardized testing. High performers are deemed more deserving - the idea of meritocracy. 

-   E.g. Access to scholarships and grants that do not consider financial background
-   E.g for bursaries that are meant to provide financial aid, the household income is considered and students need to justify their financial situation in order to prove their deservedness for financial aid to continue their education system
-   E.g. GEP
-   E.g. Cut off points/banding systems as a way to differentiate students into different schools and educational pathways. Streaming into different classes as well
