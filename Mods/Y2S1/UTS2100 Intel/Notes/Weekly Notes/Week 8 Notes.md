## Is Enterprise Singapore a Policy

- Element of integration
- Policy will be linked to Singapore Green Plan
- Impact is companies get more financing for implementation of green tech
- More of an instrument than a policy
	- Policy goal is not so clear, but is there (improvement of Singapore to reach new green targets)
- Mechanisms -> loans and capital
- Incentivization for people to take up the loans
- Money can help develop new technologies
	- Aggregate expertise and 
- Regulate people

### This discussion will consider questions concerning policies and how to create them.
What can we make sure that our policies are ethical? How do we know that the policies we make will not result in major unintended side effects or how to minimize them if any?

### Revenge Effect
Implement a policy that tries to minimize an impact but ends up causing further harm. Is the cure worse than the disease?
May result in many unnecessary surgeries that may take place as there is an incentive to do more surgeries.
Think about the policy of *negative outcomes*

## Which of Bostrom's futures are depicted here? How does this relate to today's discussion of futures and enhancement.
Do artefacts have politics
Massive groupthink - mass communication


### What kind of future does each represent? How feasible does it seem? What assumptions does it make?

**Future:**
-   Enhanced individual abilities, supposed longer life spans or healthier lives
-   Individiuals will either be enhanced in one category or across all category
-   Limited by preference of parents, loss of genetic diversity
-   Lack of ideological diversity
-   Groupthink
-   Radical thoughts to “try” and improve our lives are removed entirely
-   We might have to rethink ethics and what's permitted or not permitted entirely as humanity tries to play God.
-   Greater inequalities between the poor and the rich
-   Happening today but can reach extremes with the introduction of more exclusive technologies

**Feasibility:**
-   Very feasible, anything can happen, we can't predict the future perfectly. However, based on projections and current data that we can extrapolate, we can see such technologies develop and become increasingly more invasive and pervasive in our lives.  

**Assumptions:**
-   Free will vs herd mentality
-   Choice made by who for whom?
-   New social norms that progress over time (IVF is normalized now)
-   Humans willingly subject ourselves to this new change, go with the flow instead of fighting in just like in 1984/BNW (enslaving ourselves willingly)
-   Technology will still progress at the rate its going or even faster
-   Humans have not destroyed each other by then (climate change/nuclear war)
-   Genetic factors can be the sole determinant of phenotype exhibition 
-   E.g environmental factors, development
-   The benefits of genetically modifying individuals will outweigh the harms.
    

1.  Biomedical enhancements 
	1.  Drugs that enhance a person's intelligence/ability
	2.  We may see a future where drugs are more efficient to produce and have less side effects
	3.  Assumes that there are no limits to human brain function or capacity

	1.  No limits to the application of drugs 
	2.  No limits to the development of drugs / may be overshadowed by new technologies such a genetic modification that completely removes the need for pharmacology  


2.  Selective breeding (i.e. eugenics <3) 
	1.  Can be done without technology
	2.  May result in loss of genetic diversity -> humanity will be more prone to viruses/inbreeding depression
	3.  Selective breeding in the past, people who are deemed to have undesirable traits or genes do not have the choice to reproduce
		1.  Must be mentioned that there is no objective method of determining what is desirable or undesirable    
		2.  Ethical concerns -> in the past people were sterilized against their will so they do not pass on their “undesirable” traits to the next generation
	4. Currently, screening embryos or gametes for Any trait with a non-negligible heritability —including cognitive capacity which could then become susceptible to selection.
		1.  More and more feasible today with the decreasing costs of genome sequencing
	5.  It assumes that the embryo is not alive, else there will be ethical concerns with the termination of premature humans (at which point does it becomes eugenics)  


3.  Genetic “spell-checking” of embryo  
	1.  Construct version of genome that is free of mutations and deleterious alleles  

4.  Reproductive cloning 
-   Replicate the genome of exceptionally talented individuals
	- Limited by the preference of most prospective parents to be biologically related to their children
	- Could have non-negligible impact because (1) even a relatively small increase in the number of exceptionally talented people might have a significant effect; and (2) it is possible that some state would embark on a larger-scale eugenics program, perhaps by paying surrogate mothers

**Group 1 Whole Brain Emulation**
- AI will be more humanlike, as if we can make actual humans
- Cloning or identifying brain waves 
- Ethical issues of who is a real person. Person who died outside of the system
- Playing god through the creation of human life
- **Qualia**
	- Quality of consciousness that we cant replicate using neurological processes. There is another hidden element beyond brain operations.
	- Engagement within a body and the environment
	- Interaction with the environment
	- What human experience and conscious is
	- Black box worries us as we cant account for everyones intelligence
	- 


**Group 2 Networks and Organization**
- WWW: sharing of information more prominent now
	- Democratization of the internet
- Rather propagating sameness, it propagates differences

**Group 3 Brain Computer Interfaces**
- Seeks to remove the instruments that we use to access the internet and information
- Feasibility is difficult as humans do not store information the same way that a computer does
- There should be value to be found when communicating such information directly to the brain
- Assumes that audience is willing to subject themselves to this
	- What if they are unable to choose (brain death)
- Mind control

**Group 4 Biological Cognition**
- Do artefacts have ethics
- May cause a high level of harm
- Political dimension to gene embryo technology
- Lack of relationship between what we want and how we get there
	- We don't talk about what are these traits, how do we quantify better

## What are the general characteristics of the futures associated with Bostrum's path to superintelligence? How do they describe intelligence?
- General intelligence
- Physical improvements could be a form of intelligence
- For intelligence to be in place, it is argued that we need a nervous system
	- Cant separate consciousness from other parts of the brain

Industry 5.0 with focuses and challenges caused or neglected in industry 4.0
Systems need to be more personalized to people.
Creativity, forming strategy, showing foresight.
Make reasonable solutions
stem cell therapy
