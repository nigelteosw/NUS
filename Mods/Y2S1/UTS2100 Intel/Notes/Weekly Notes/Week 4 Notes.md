### What skillsets are needed to build an experiment?
Not a single skillset
People who can write, people who can critique, people who are good practically

### Creativity Test
We haven't learnt a whole lot, as it just ranks people on a scale.
Results on a first try are worst than second try.
How does practice affect performance?
Language has a big impact on linguistic intelligence.

Getting people to improve on a same trial or improve on a similar trial.

Stress on child, have to do well in sports and CCA.

## [[Frames of Mind]]
Gardner's theory does not contradict with g
Nurture comes into play
Gardner's tries to split it up into how a person thinks and why he/she thinks in this manner
g does not account for executive actions

Difference between Gardner's intelligence
- Contextualized/personalized to just one person
- g looks at a baseline intelligence compared to other people
- both can be correct as they are looking at different things
- How do we *compare* these theories?

Measure presence of such intelligence, just as much consider the absence of intelligence.
Absence of performance is also important.
What does it mean to have 0 IQ?
How to break down scores?

## [[Healthy Competition and Unsound Comparison]]
DSA have caused competition in other fields, sports, music and arts.
Visibility of scoring, the way scores are presented. 
- How this drives competition within holistic education
- Threat of punishment?

Obsession with rankings, which trickles down into the education system. 
1) Just get candidates to do the question paper
2) Score will be declared with your name in the MPH

Talked about to be detached, exams difficult for the benefit of students, to push them to make them try harder.

### Remove imaginary competition, there will be still be symbolic competition.###
**Symbolic Competition**
- Objective measure of a persons ability.
- What happens when the number is being taken out of context, how the score relates to others.
- Two are deeply connected to each other

Singapore's mindset is so hard to change. If the whole system takes so long and not rewarded for changing the mindset, people who subscribe to that will eventually lose out.

Competition is rife among teachers, parents, ministers, yet we do not hear competition among students.
There is an air of wanting, to be better than others yet it was not that big.
Could be something that we cannot change, but that may be a good thing for Singapore.
- Ability is similar with those from other country's systems
- Solution could be not abolish competition, but not everyone can do well under stress
- Just because we are used to it does not mean that we should keep it
- This method as a foundation may not be good to maintain status quo
	- State society disconnect makes it hard for policies to really impact the people who need to be supported

Reducing contact hours, to pursue own interests. Produce more space for students to learn.

## [[Developmental Milestones During the First Three Years as Precursors of Adult Intelligence]]

### Discussions
Nothing too opaque about the steps of the test.
- things that can be observed relatively easy
- increased validity

Milestones went broader, one of the milestones may be more important than others.

A link to: [[Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development]]
An assumption that they build on each other. A unidirectional movement from left to right.

What about prodigies?

Two points of data, early adulthood (BPP) and late adulthood (WAIS).

Social-economic status of the child?
Parity? First, second third child?
Mother's smoking recorded?

If we are good at language, does the early childhood development matters?

## [[The Heritability of Intelligence]]

Cultural-loading
A lot of contention in this paper.



## [[Wired that Way]] 

Genes affect but do not predict intelligence.
