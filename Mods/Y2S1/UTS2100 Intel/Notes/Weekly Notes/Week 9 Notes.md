# Week 9 Notes

## Thoughts on Enhancement 

 ### Conservative
 - Traditional approach + non-approval
 - Playing God 
	 - Sacredness of 'humanness'
 - Threat to species
 - What is the common good? (who dictates it which may be too big a problem)
 - Enhancement disrupts order which has taken a long time to achieve 
 - Unintended consequences
 - We should trust our gut feeling because of our disgust of it

### Restrictive
- Egalitarian approach (can also support conservative arguments)
- Eugenics
- Problem of too much agency
- Safety tradeoffs

### Permissive (Liberal)
- Supportive + individual
- Genetic lottery is unfair
	- Society that imposes the unfairness 
- Humanness is just an idea that is not subscribed by all
- Appeal to individual rights (choice)
	- Consent
- Taboos are meant to guide ethics and society, evolved over time
	- Respect the emotional response
	- May slowly become normative such as technologies such as IVFs


#### Moral Modules
- Conservative evoke not as good emotions  
	- Involve a broader range of emotions
- Liberals invited more high minded modules
	- Respond to the initial idea and reason with it outside of emotion 
- Emotions are the basis of making moral decisions, then post rationalization of the decision 
- Emotions don't work that way when we think it should 
	- Mixture of emotion and reasoning (more complex)


#### Ontology
- The way that post-modern humans evolve, humans have divided themselves from nature.
	- Nature used to be a resource that we are able to exploit
	- Not a part of nature, but apart from it
	
## Ethics and Applicability to Singapore

### Whole Brain Emulation
Possibility of whole brain emulation without affecting the brain. You are being tied to the world and your experiences in the world that make u human

We don't know that we are in a simulation and at this point we cannot test it
- Healthy not to think that way -> moral consequences

Replacing a lot of human workers in the workplace

Injection of emotions into the AI system that emulates the brain
- Purpose of emotion to push the emulator to work harder
- Emotions becomes commodified

Singapore loves human capital
- Quick fix to the problem


### Networking and Organisation
Network uses brains to do computing
New and not yet known health effects
Renting out neural processing to companies for money
Perspective of harm - conservatives and restrictive
Negative consequences - used by conservatives


### Brain Computer Interface
Not really an enhancement but a tool
People will be open to hacking, easy to monitor employees
It can be like a drug
Doors of Perception -> book by Aldous Huxley
Ethical issues that are black boxed 

Ethics and emotions are wrapped up tightly
- Can include rational reasoning, emotions are also needed. 
- One or the other can be very dangerous

### Biomedical Enhancements 
The Singaporean government is focused on hitting KPI and productivity. I can see a future where we attempt to keep our human resource competitive, not through meritocracy, but through Nigenics©. 

Low birth rate in Singapore, 38% of people have not dated before, giving lab grown babies to people to raise is kinda cool.

Conservative:


-   It is immoral to attempt to create life through non-natural methods 
	-   Playing god, gong against natural procreation methods 
	-   Idea that we are born in the likeness of god, NOT ME
-   Defiling sacredness of ‘humanness’ by altering ourselves and taking away what makes us human - Our differences
-   Consent for others: deciding for people who have not been born
-   Negative consequences: 
	-   safety issue, perhaps some cases of the Nigenics© integration are not successful, what will happen to those babies?
	-   Furthermore, as societies and time changes, the society may demand different factors (e.g interpersonal intelligence fades out in importance)
-   Is it easy to draw a mapping between genes and abilities?
-   We may discover other genes that induces higher EQ
-   Nigenics© may not be the only genes out there that induces higher EQ
-   May risk further perpetuation of inequality 

  
Restrictive:
-   Problems (genetic or behavioural) issues with the lab grown babies
-   Babies will be born with back pains and overwhelming neuroticism 
-   Inequality when people are unable to afford the designer babies
-   What kind of modifications we are doing 
	-   Where are the stem cells coming from
	-   How do we know that it will not cause side effects? (babies won’t die prematurely)
	-   Who decides that children should be enhanced? 
-   Which sections of the Nigenics© are useful, to what extent do the genes not affect other parts of the whole human
-   Idea of nature of nurture, whether the children will still be effective if provided different experiences as they grow up


Permissive:
-   Genetic lottery is unfair, and that is why liberalism has elements of both body positivity and choice. Nigenics© would remove that barrier of body positivity, and allow people to focus merely on choices that they want. Allowing people to be more liberal without limitations of physicality. 
-   Change is normal, and there is nothing wrong with starting the same, as through our life experiences and environment, we will all end up as different forms of Nigel. 
-   Allowing everyone to beginning on the same starting point


## Are Machines Intelligent?

### Yes
- Within a 'space' machines do act autonomously and learn
- Humans don't set goal, are programmed
- Machines can use past experiences
- There is nothing theoretically impossible about machines
- Humans cant learn in certain areas either
- Machines are intelligent in different ways

### No
- Just regurgitation, no recognition just mapping
- Not general only specialized
- No general knowledge
- Machines can't really learn autonomously
- Machines don't set goals
	- link to ontological approach
	- an intention to act, guided by ethics
	- no sense of what is right and wrong
	- don't understand context and why certain decisions are made
	- naïve about the world outside and the true impact of their decision
- Can't easily change viewpoints (humans are fickle)
- 'does a machine really 'know''
- lacking an 'overall' intelligence
- It is created
- Operate in spaces that are limited in complexity


### neurological
- represents the brain crudely
- still very fundamental compared to actual brain activity

### perceptual
- machines can relearn and adjust based on the dataset

### ontological
- do not engage the world in the same world
- interacting through mediation with humans
- our relationship with the world humans do
- this is the important bit
	- the way machines relate to the world
	- experience -> can we say it experiences the world the same way humans do

### epistemological
- they can never access what is true and false
- a machine is not in a position to make a judgement of true or falsehood
- hard to say that a machine has knowledge the same way a human has knowledge


Machines may be intelligent but they do not exhibit judgement
Claim that judgement is the standard to which human thinking can aspire

Humans are able to answer to why we did an action. 
- making sense of the memory
- introspective and retrospective thoughts
- an intention to act, guided by ethics
- no sense of what is right and wrong
- don't understand context and why certain decisions are made
- naïve about the world outside and the true impact of their decision
