**[[Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences]]**


## Classism
Idea of language that can construct certain groups
- neighborhood school vs prestigious school

Do additional reading in emotional intelligence.
- Testing for emotional intelligence
- Stress levels affecting intelligence?

Start thinking about policies that our test can change
- Significance of findings to society?
- Future extensions?

Go into the paper and ask what are the implications. There is something that is worrying in the paper. Criticism and impact.

Key things and key interests
Write about intelligence tests

Consider policy within Singapore
What intelligence do I want to think through?
How to put that into the study.
Maybe I have no idea what I'm doing.

Theory of Knowledge
IB subject
Art Education more money needs to be put in it
Why is it important to consider existential intelligence

Nature vs nurture
Hard work is a form of intelligence
Motivation and consistency

Experience (pathway affecting motivations) -> achievements
Tradeoff between deep study and data
Ask about experience

Interpersonal intelligence/Intrapersonal intelligence
perception

## What are some of the main concepts and perspectives you gained from each of the readings? Please note the reading you are referring to: Gottfredson (2003); Deng and Gopinathan (2016). ##

## Gotffredson (2003) ##
**Research papers are not immune to biasness**
"They do so partly by appealing to many people’s strong desire to believe them, specifically, by tapping the popular preference for an egalitarian plurality of intelligences (everyone can be smart in some way) and a distaste for being assessed, labeled, and sorted by inscrutable mental tests."

The idea that even findings can be skewed in such a way to push a certain narrative. As it is a research paper, the general public might be more inclined to perceive this idea as truth.

## What is practical intelligence theory? What are Gottfredson’s (2003) main arguments against it? Do you find them convincing? Pose one question that you think the Gottfredson (2003) reading addresses. Answer it. What is Deng and Gopinathan’s (2016) main argument about the factors that contribute / do not contribute to Singapore’s success in PISA rankings? Do you agree? Pose one question that you think the Deng and Gopinathan’s (2016) reading addresses. Answer it. ##

## Deng and Gopinathan’s (2016) ##

**Singapore’s education system (built on her historical and cultural contexts) is targeted towards developing skills to built a society targeting economic growth, which coincidentally are what PISA prioritizes in testing for (mathematics, science, reading comprehension)
- “Primary goal of education underpinning PISA is economic - developing skills and competencies for the economy in the twenty-first century” (p. 464)
- “We seek to nurture the whole child and develop them into lifelong learners, with an enduring core of competencies to thrive in the twenty-first century.”


Despite the Asian education model being largely conservative, directed towards the transmission of predetermined content and skills and examination performance, why does Singapore still do well in PISA tests?
- PISA test does not necessarily fulfil what it sets out to do: “Sjoberg (2007) argues that PISA contains only paper-and-pencil items which are basically ‘decontextualized’ and ‘non-controversial’, incapable of assessing the skills and competencies required for dealing with contextualized, uncertain, and contentious problems” (p, 463)
