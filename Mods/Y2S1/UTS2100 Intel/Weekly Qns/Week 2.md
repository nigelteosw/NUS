# Brainstorm questions that can guide you when designing and administering an intelligence test. Describe and reflect on your intelligence test in your learning journal. Consider: what your test really tests, what the results are and what you can conclude. Consider any shortcomings. #

## [[Designed Test]] ##

I would like to test both [[Musical Intelligence]] and [[Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence]]. I would use a rhythm game to test a person’s hand eye coordination, reaction time, and their ability to adapt and learn over time. I think it would  be interesting to determine if there might be a relation between reaction time and intelligence. I also would like to seek to prove if they have the ability to learn to do the activity better in the short period of time by making them run the experiment again.

Before designing and administering an intelligence test, we must first come up with questions to determine the purpose of testing. There are many tangible factors that can be used to determine ability such as reaction time, time taken to accomplish a task or accuracy of completing the task. 

### Results from test ###
| Name | First Attempt | Second Attempt | Played Before |
| ----- | ------ | -----| ---- |
| Andre | 4969 | 7634 | No |
| Kok Hai | 14386 | 15424 | No |
| Ian | 9814 | 15873 | Yes |
| Nigel | 16368 | 15266 | Yes |

From the results of the test, we can clearly see that the participants have generally improved from the first attempt to the second attempt. From this, we cannot say that intelligence is only due to nature, but we can surely conclude that nurture has the ability to determine intelligence. This is important to establish as it suggests that a human has an innate ability to learn and get better through experience or that experience might have a part to play in intelligence.

Another observation that is that participants who have played osu! before have generally better results than those that do not. This can be alluded to the the idea that experience does play a part in intelligence through the application of prior knowledge.

The problem I have found with this test is that some people may innately be better at moving their mouse or tracking a dot across a screen because they have better hand-eye coordination, which is a skill that requires us to coordinate our visual and motor skills, a not necessarily a type intelligence. Still it might be useful to giving us insight as to whether reaction time or hand-eye coordination is a good metric to determine intelligence.

### Pitfalls of using [[Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences]] ###
Another important point of contention is about using Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences itself as a method of classifying different kinds of intelligence. From my observation, there is an overlap between some of the types of intelligence that he proposes. For instance, [[Spatial Intelligence]] does have some overlap with [[Naturalist Intelligence]] as both has to deal with visualisation, and therefore naturalist intelligence might be a subset of spatial intelligence. 

Another criticism is, the classification of some intelligences when they could arguably be talents such as [[Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence]] and [[Musical Intelligence]]. From my test, users who have not touched the game osu! before can generate different initial outcomes (Andre and Kok Hai) due to their ability to follow a steady rhythm or affinity for video games. However, this test is also similar to dexterity test as it is evaluating the ability to "intelligently" use a mouse. It is not a test of your intelligence in and of itself. As such, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence might not be able to be used as a metric to determine intelligence.

A funny anecdote occurs to me; one of the world's elite footballers, Jack Grealish, was unable to point out his hometown on a map of England in an interview, yet he was still sold for 100m to Manchester City due to his footballing ability. Yet this anecdote may support the idea of multiple intelligence as a person could be geniuses in their own specialized fields. Hence, even in sport, a persons build and size has far more to do with genetics rather than a form of intelligence.


## What do you want to learn in this seminar? What is it to participate in a seminar? How do you define intelligence?

## How do you know how intelligent you are? How were standard metrics like IQ evolved? What are the politics and assumptions of such metrics? Can we question them? How prevalent is IQ and other metrics as an intelligence measure (in Singapore) today? Is there more than one intelligence? What can we measure and what evades measurement?
