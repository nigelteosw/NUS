## What are the futures associated with intelligence? How realistic are these futures? How do they conceive the relationship between intelligence and labour? What are the practical and theoretical limits of human intelligence? What technology (e.g. drugs, dieting, genetic engineering, surgery, implants) can or has been used make us more intelligent? Which of these is ethical to use and why? How does the recent history of enhancement change how we conceive intelligence in Singapore?


I use *judgment* for the normative ideal to which I argue we should hold full-blooded human  intelligence-a form of dispassionate deliberative thought, grounded in ethical commitment and responsible action, appropriate to the situation in which it is deployed. Not every human cognitive act meets this idea-not even every conscious act of every person we call intelligent. I claim only that judgment is the standard to which human thinking can aspire.” (Cantwell-Smith, 2019:xv)


“I use the term *reckoning* for the types of calculative prowess at which computer and AI systems already excel-skills of extraordinary utility and importance, on which there is every reason to suppose computers will continue to advance…, but skills embodied in devices that lack ethical commitment, deep contextual awareness and ontological sensitivity of judgment.” (Cantwell-Smith, 2019:xvi)
