# Combinatorial Circuits 

- Two classes of logic circuits
	- Combinatorial circuits
	- Sequential circuits


## Analysis Procedure
**Steps**
1. Label the inputs and outputs
2. Obtain the functions of intermediate points and the outputs
3. Draw the truth table
4. Deduce the functionality of the circuit


## Design Methods
- Different design methods
	- Gate-level design method (with logic gates)
	- Block-level design method (with functional blocks)

- Purpose of circuit design:
	- Reduce cost
	- Increase speed
	- Design simplicity


## Gate-Level (SSI) Design: Half Adder
1. State problem
2. Determine and label the inputs and outputs of the circuit
3. Draw the truth table
4. Obtain simplified Boolean Functions
5. Draw the logic diagram


## BCD to Excess-3 Code
