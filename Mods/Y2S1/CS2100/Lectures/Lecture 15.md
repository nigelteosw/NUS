# Simplification

## Function Simplification

### Techniques
- **Algebraic**
	- Using theorems
	- Open-ended; requires skills
- **Karnaugh Maps**
	- Easy to use
	- Limited to no more than 6 variables
- **Quine-McCluskey** (non-examinable)
	- Suitable for automation
	- Can handle many variables

## Algebraic Simplification
Using brain to do simplification using theorems

## Half Adder
**Half adder** is a circuit that adds 2 single bits (X, Y) to produce a result of two bits (C, S)

- Use exclusive OR gate to get the S output
- Use AND gate to get the C output

## Grey Code
- Unweighted
- Only a single bit change from one code value to the next

## Introduction to K-maps
- Advantage: Easy to use
- Disadvantage: Limited to 5 or 6 variables
- An abstract form of Venn diagram, organized as a matrix of squares
