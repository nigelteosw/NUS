The single feature that distinguishes forensic scientists from any other scientist is the certain expectation that they will testify in court and testify to their findings and ***offer*** an opinion as to the ***significance*** of these findngs.

The forensic scientist will testify not only to what things are, but to what things mean.



The CSI effect posits that exposure to ***television programmes*** that portray forensic science (e.g., CSI: Crime Scene Investigation) can change the way jurors evaluate forensic evidence

If we tunnel vision into only 1 Case Theory. We miss out on the objective truth.

## Who, What, When, Where, How ##

The three types of mortis are **livor mortis, algor mortis, and rigor mortis**. They all occur within 48 hours after death.

- Edmond Locard's first crime lab (Lyons, France) ~1910
	- "Every contact leaves a trace."

blood and body measurements

Using luminol as a means to test for traces of blood.

### Dr Henry C Lee's 4-way Linkage Theory ###

Victim, Suspect, Object, Crime Scene, Physical Evidence
The more linkages there are, the stronger the case.



### Association ###
- Disassociation
	- Elimination from a class (extremely powerful)!
	  
### Individualisation ###
- Where the item is unique or attributed to a single source 
	- e.g. fingerprint, DNA profiling, jigsaw matches, matching strias
	  
### Reconstruction ###

Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)
Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS)
National Integrated Ballistic Identification Network (NIBIN)
Database Files with Profiles or Images from Unsolved Cases
- Links person to crime scene
- Links different crime scenes


### Clinical & Forensic Toxicology Unit: ###
36-year-old Toh Cheng Yang pleaded guilty to not just causing death by dangerous driving, but also driving under the influence of ***nitrazepam*** – a sedative known to cause drowsiness and fatigue. The level of the drug found in Toh was around five to 15 times the amount needed for medicinal use, and twice the level at which it produces the toxic effects such as drowsiness.
