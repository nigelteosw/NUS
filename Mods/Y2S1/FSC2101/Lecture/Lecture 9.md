## Forensic Medicine (FSC2101)

Consent required from coroner if there are plans for organ harvesting

**Hypostasis**
- Due to chemicals broken down by the blood
- Before the first few hours, blood pooling due to gravity

**Putrefaction**
- Depends on the environement and if there is water nearby
- Bodies take a few weeks before skeletonization
- Marbling due to haemoglobin staining the blood vessels
- Bloating due to gasses in the intestine
- Body starts to turn green due to tissues releasing pigments
- Adipocere
	- Bodies submerged in salt water
	- The fat under the skin is exposed and reacts with the salt in the salt water to form a different kind of fat
	- A way soap is made
- Skeletonisation
	- Very difficult to tell when a person has been dead
	- Fresh skeletonised bone is not white. yellowish color
	- When sun bleaches the bone, it turns whiter

**Deviated Nasal Septum**
- Bent nose
- If sharp bend could mean that there was sustained trauma

**Enlarged Parietal Foramen** 
- Holes at the top of the skull for blood vessels
- Can be normal (blunted edges)


### Deceased person:
- Coroner will decide based on what the pathologist has said
	- If this is a suicide, homicide, natural or accident


### Classification
- Blunt force
	- Abrasion 
		- Injury to superficial layer of the skin. 
		- Caused by blunt force trauma.
	- Contusion (bruise)
		- Bleeding under the skin or in an organ 
		- Due to blunt trauma
	- Laceration 
		- Skin injury where skin is broken 
		- Caused by blunt force or rolling
- Sharp force
	- Incised wound
		- Skin is broken and has sharp edges 
		- Caused by sharp edged objects 
		- Includes ‘stab wound’.
		- (Tentative wounds) Wounds that are inflicted by suicidal tendencies
		- Self inflicted stab brachial artery (front of elbow) to bleed to death - may appear to have 2 cuts if the stab was inflicted when the elbow is bent
		- When people try to cut their wrists, they usually inflict superficial, hesitation cuts (tentative wounds) to assess how painful it is. Then when they make up their mind, they will make a very deep cut. Often they also cut their tendon (which controls the movement of their wrist) - so if they dont die, they need to repair the tendon. The radial artery at the wrist is very deep thus it takes a long time to die from cutting the wrist.
		- Cutting throats - cut the carotid vein / internal jugular artery at the side of the neck. The artery is very deep, thus you should throw the head back before cutting it.
		- Wounds that are not parallel and not grouped in an area where its not easily accessible indicates a non-suicide
- Neither sharp nor blunt
	- Burns


### Defence wounds
- Wounds sustained due to natural reaction of victims to protect themselves during assault
- Victim must be conscious 
- At least partly mobile
- Not taken completely by surprise
- Blunt force – bruises are hallmarks, sometimes with abrasions. Fractures of hand bones may occur. 
- Sharp weapon – incised wounds. 
- Gunshot.

**Typical locations**
- Mainly forearms / hands (raised to protect face). 
- Can be on thighs when shielding genitals (eg during kicking). 
- Palm side of hands and fingers if victim grabs knife.
