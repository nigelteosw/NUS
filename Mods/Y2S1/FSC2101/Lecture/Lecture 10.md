# Lecture 10

2005, DNA techniques much slower, police wanted a faster way of identifying head 
**Teeth**
- Looked at teeth, one of the upper teeth of the left side was crooked, turned to one side and had a chip along th edge of the tooth 
- Looked at photos of her when she was alive and smiling (pic taken in company event) 
- The tooth matched, congenital abnormality 
- Chip cant be seen clearly in the picture she was alive in , L -shape gap can see tooth is twisted
- Malformation of the tooth - 1 in 1000 to 1 in 5000, not a common abnormality in the chinese 
- Using this tooth told the police, can say that there is a 1 in 1000 chance … head was liu 
- She had a gap between the 2 teeth on the right side 
- 2 markers gave them a confirmation that it was her in the pic 

**Decomposition**
- Area where she was cut is exposed to the elements, decomposes much faster 
- All the skin and the muscle in the cut area in the neck was too decomposed to tell if there were any injuries there 
- Leong confessed that he strangled her with a towel, can see rough towel marks on the skin, but her skin was too decomposed to tell 

**Hyoid bone**
- Hyoid bone 
- Thyroid cartilage forms the adams apple
- In strangulations, front cartilages can be broken like adams apple (V-shaped) 
- Thyroid cartilage begins to calcify and turns to bone as we grow older 
- She was 22 so it was more cartilage like than bone like 
- If the person is young, when cartilage is pressed, it would not be broken when pressed.
- When you apply a force is applied over 
- When you use a towel which is broad you have less force per square area 
- You don't see any injuries on the thyroid cartilage 
- Bone above the thyroid cartilage is the hydroid bone, much nearer the chin, connected by muscle, nearer to jaw 
- Will not cause fracture when pressed (shaped like a horseshoe, U shaped, negative findings here) 
- Can’t see if there is any bleeding there as there was no skin 

Even if force was applied, it did not cause injuries to the neck (soft cartilage on thyroid, insufficient force) 

== no objective findings**

### Body parts found at river
- Paper bag with torso
- Plastic bags wrapping the two body parts


### Evidence found in suspect's flat
- Mallet
- Newspaper
	- Newspaper from flat and newspapers used to wrap head were the same
	- Look at the edges along newspaper to look at microscopically 
	- Printing press will cut the newspapers everyday, either the same machine or could change**
- Suspects sandals
- Chopper
	- Dented edge on chopper
	- Metal pieces from the body parts (collected at autopsy)
	- Metal fragments physically fit chipped cutting edge of chopper
	- 160, 165, 175 microscopic fragments
- Suspect's bicycle
	- Blood from Liu got into the basket
- Pails and clogs
	- Blood dna was extracted that matched that of Liu
- Lift door
	- Blood found at the lift door
- Masking tape edges
	- Same batch of masking tape used to tape up boxes found in the apartment

### Soil and materials
- Sandals can be determined to be at Kalling Riverside park
- Bougainvillea thorn
- Sandy particles
- Micro-shells: soil of coastal or riverine origin
- Soil and materials matched material at river banks where body parts were disposed of

**19 May 2006**
Mr Leong was sentenced to death.
Justice Tay Yong Kwang
- In the classic tragic tale of ill-fated love, the luckless lover committed suicide. Here, Romeo killed Juliet. It was a most disgusting and despicable muder.

**September 2006**
- Appeal rejected by court of appeal
- There is automatic appeal for cases in death penalty

## Burns
- Lightning
	- Arborisation (Lichtenberg figures)
	- 500k volts to 1M volts, current is very high
	- Resistance of skin is very low due to sweat
	- No matter the resistance of the ovject, lighting can still flow through
	- Most dangerous - when lightning flows across vital organs = brain, heart, lungs
	- Derangement of ions in the brains and the hearts, organ failure
	- Lightning will char the skin as it passes through it
	- Left armpit, left side hip
		- all the water suddenly vaporises and expands in volume
		- it tears all the clothes off the person
		- Left foot into the ground
		  
- Dry heat (explosion)
	- Blisters forming, fluid accumulating in the fluid
	- Blisters can break and a fusion of blister to underlying skin
	- Flash fire (chemical explosion)
		- Heat from radiation and conduction (heated air hence dry burn)
		  
- Wet heat (e.g. scald)
	- Steam or by boiling water
	- blistering, skin will come off
	- the distribution of the injuries is forensically important
	- left side of the body of the baby is burnt
		- heat must be coming from the left side
		- dipped in hot water
		  
- Electrical
	- High voltage 
	- Home or in commercial industries
	- At home voltage is low at 220V
		- Electricity does not travel like high voltage lighting
	- Step down generators have high voltage
		- Few thousand volts
		- Current can spark through the air if enough high V - Can see areas of burn starting from random areas
	- Joule burn (low voltage, 220V in most commonwealth countries,  whereas in US = 110V) = localized burn, brown cratered mark
	- Normally observed on hands which are holding the live equipment
	  
- Chemical (eg Acid)
	- Strong acids like HF acids
	- Burns are worse where he was wearing clothes - clothes were stuck to skin when water was sprayed to wash it (prolonged contact)
	- Most acids or alkalis can't firmly diagnose what it is
	- HF bruns the skin gray
	- Drank sulfuring acid burns, blackening of the stomach

## Asphysia - no pulse(true meaning) - lack of oxygen
- Lack of oxygen (suffocation)

- Smothering/overlaying

- Gagging

- Thorax prevented from moving

- External Neck Compression

- Hanging

### Classified
- Outside the body
	- Oxygen that is not at the right concentration, cant pass via osmosis
- Ideal concentration of oxygen = 20%+
- Too little concentration in the air, difference in pressure in the air and the oxygen in the blood is not condusive for oxygen to pass through the lungs
- Enclosed spaces - marine trade, ships
	- Oil tankers contain pateroleum product remnants after being emptied out, volatiles will vaporise pushing oxygen out of the cargo = cleaners suffocate upon entering

- On the body surface
	- Gagging
		- Cover the nose / mouth to prevent breathing - hand, fabric, pillow, cotton stuffing, towel gag
	- Overlaying
		- An infant is covered up by a heavy object
		- Cannot move on their own
		- Rolling over an infant while mother is sleeping
	- Breathing done by abdomen
		- Force generated by diaphragm, when pressure drops relative to atmospheric oxygen, air rushes into lungs
	- Put victim face down on floor and kneel on his back - prevent chest/abdomen movement and thus cannot breathe
	- Nose and mouth through neck into lungs
	- Anything that causes external neck compression also causes lack of oxygen
		- Can be hand, forearm, rope = ligature strangulation

- In the body
	- Airways blocked from an object
	- Disease that prevents air from entering lungs
	- Oxygen in blood cannot enter cells
		- Cyanide poisoning
		- Carbon Monoxide

**Signs of asphyxia (triad)**
- Facial congestion
	- Facial congestion with deoxygenated blood
	- Face is swollen and red
	  
- Cyanosis
	- Purple or blue appearance of blood (redness of blood)
	- Pull down eyelids
	- Lips turn blue
	  
- Petechial haemorrages
	- Pintpoint dots of bleeding usually occuring in the eyes or face
	- small red dots within the eyelids

**Plastic Bag asphyxia**
- Lack of oxygen - Suffocation
	- Plastic bag asphyxia (glue sniffing)

**Gagging**
- 75 year old woman, victim of robbery
	- secretions of nose and mouth go onto towel, air can no longer pass through

**Externall chest compression**
- knee mount
	- Police put him face down
	- Kneeling on the back (cannot expand abdomen)
	- Hands behind back prevent chest from expanding
	- What happened to George Floyd
- neck lock / arm choke
- hog tied (hands behind back, knees bent and feet on buttocks)

**Positional asphyxia**
- drunk and coming down staircase
- body fell in such a way his neck was against the wall
- Face down and legs are bent
- Semi-hog tied position
- Case study

	- 8.20am friends called him to pick him up to airport
	- No reply
	- Chest is on a step that prevents abdoment from breathing
	- Face was blue from cyanosis

**External chest compression**
- Burried up to neck
	- cannot expand the chest and cannot breathe

**Manual Strangulation**
**Ligature Strangulation**
- Using rope
- Hanging
	- Incomplete suspension
		- L foot on floor
		- R foot on chair
		- kneeling with the feed folded
- Dependent hypostasis
	- blood settles and 

- Child swalloed by a python
- Man fell into a corn silo

**Sexual (autoerotic) Asphyxia**
- The practice of using strangulation to enhance pleasure of masturbation and orgasm
- Slang terms
	- Scarfing
	- Terminal play etc
- Production of cerebral hypoxia
- Heighten pleasure?
- Usually young adult males
- Self applied bondage
- Escape mechanism
- Death occurs when escape mechanism fails
- Mummification

**Life lessons from the practice of forensic medicine**
- negative experiences profound
- Rewarding:
	- knowing that you helped
	- camaraderie
	- social bonding
	- working togther
	- professional learning
	- personal development and insight
	- re-ordering of life priorities
