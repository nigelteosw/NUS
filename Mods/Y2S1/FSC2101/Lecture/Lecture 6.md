## Forensic Examination of Firearms

- Forensic firearms examiner
	- Toolmarks examiner

- Firearms are made out of many moving parts
	- frame - supports the other parts
	- action - trigger, firing pin and ammo
	- barrel - directs projectile to target

- Barrel is rifled in handguns and rifles
	- class characteristics - manufacturer distinct
	- gives greater accuracy and stability

- Shotguns are not rifled

- Primer ignites the propellant charge

- Empty cartriges are still at the scene
	- still reusable

- Serial numbers can be recovered through chemical processes or electrolytic etching
	- metal structure weakened
- Functionality of weapon
- Bullets will fragment and deform
	- use water tanks to test/ballistic gel

- Ejector and Extractor will push the old bullet out of the gun
	- same weapon will leave same type of marks

- Gun shot residue
	- end up on the shooter hands
	- Major components of the primer â€“ high explosive consisting of *lead* styphnate, *barium* nitrate and *antimony* sulfide
	- using scanning electron microscope (SEM)

- bullet will pick up trace material from the wall
