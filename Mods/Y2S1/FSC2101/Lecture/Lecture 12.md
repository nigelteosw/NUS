Dr Lee, talking about drug related issues in the United States

Drugs associated with violent crimes

Acid, a novel psychedelic substance and controlled drug.

**Case of Nonoi, 2**
Stepfather was on marujuana and abused cough syrup.

Any substance that produces psysiological or psycological effects on the body
- Physiological - withdrawal symptoms, physical illness
- Psychological - uncontrollable cravings


**Health Products Regulatory Branch of HSA**
- Main objective: Safeguard Public Health by wisely regulating a range of Health Products to ensure safety, quality and efficacy


**Legislation Devision**
AGC regulation team with HSA
*Health Products Act 2007*
- Counterfeit medicines may include products without their the active ingredient, with an insufficient or excessive quantity of the active ingredient, with the wrong active ingredient, or with fake packaging.
- Given the significant danger that counterfeit medicines pose to public health, many countries work together to combat their spread.

*Packaging material*
- Design
- Inks, printing quality, defects
- Material; carton,plister packs, capsules
- Security features (overt/covert)

*Drug*
- Shape, size and surface characteristics
- Chemical Ingredients
- Manufacturing marks

*Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (MDA)*
- The 1970s saw the introduction of the most sought after drug in the world: Heroin. From 1973 to 1975, Singapore experienced an exponential 200- fold increase in the number of heroin addicts.
- The MDA was enacted on 16 Feb 1973 to combat this.
- “Controlled drugs” are any substance which is specified in the First Schedule to the MDA.
- The substance can be natural or synthetic.
- The possession, consumption, manufacturing, import, export, or trafficking of controlled drugs in any amount are illegal.

Instant Urine Test (IUT)
subject matter of the high profile trial known as the Test Case in the High Court

It is an offence for a person to consume drug (section 8b of MDA) outside as well as within Singapore where he is found as a result of urine tests conducted under s31(4) of MDA (section 8A of MDA).


### Forensic Toxicologist
What’s the role of forensic toxicologist in death investigation?
What they will seek to answer.
1. Was this person poisoned? 
2. If so, what was the poison and how much of it was detected? 
3. How was it administered?
4. What were its effects?
5. Was it within the therapeutic range or beyond?

Sometimes an accidental overdose

Forensic toxicology is associated with the medico-legal aspects of toxicology (which is the study of adverse effects of chemicals and drugs on humans and animals); 

and is relevant in cases involving poisoning, drug use and death, as well as in suspected cases of doping, inhalant or drug abuse.


- All substances, including therapeutic drugs, have the potential to be toxic above a threshold.

*"All substances are poisons: there is none which is not a poison. The right dose differentiates a poison and remedy " - Paracelsus*

- • Besides the dosage, toxicity also depends on the portal of entry and frequency of administration, the individual’s age or developmental stage, gender, weight, kidney and liver functions, and health conditions.


**Toxicants**
Toxicants are chemical substances when administered by accident or design, produce adverse or deleterious responses in biological organisms.
Without metabolism or elimination, many substances would reach harmful or *toxic* concentrations in the organism


- Toxicity in the human body may be acute or chronic, and may vary from one organ to another. 
- The organs most frequently affected by toxicants are the liver, kidney, brain, lungs and gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
- Common routes of entry or exposure into the body are orally, through the skin, lungs or eyes


**3 Main Objectives**
1. Toxicants, and ascertain whether they contributed to or caused harm or death
	1. sus drug intoxication
2. Toxicants that may affect a person’s performance or behavior and ability to make rational judgement
	1. DUI driving, drug-facilitated sexual assault
3. Toxicants that are not compliant with employment regulations or classified as substance of abuse
	1. sus consumption of controlled drugs


The State Coroner is a District Judge appointed under the Coroners Act (section 3 of CA). The Coroner or the Public Prosecutor may, if he considers it appropriate to do so, direct a *forensic pathologist* to investigate the cause and circumstances connected with the death of any person (section 16 of CA).


A post-mortem examination (PM exam) may only be performed by a pathologist (section 19(1) of CA. A pathologist who has conducted any PM exam shall draw up a report of the findings and conclusions which he draws from it; certify as to the medical cause of death and send to the Coroner who ordered the PM exam (section 20(1) of CA).


A toxicology report put up by a forensic toxicologist is supposed to contain factual information on toxicants present and their concentrations, with or without interpretation.

"positive" or “detected” indicates a particular substance was identified using lab protocols.

The forensic pathologist will take in the toxicology report findings before he/she opines on the cause of death.

**General analytical workflow for controlled drug analysis**
Weighing (for solid and plant-type exhibits)
Homogenisation (for solid exhibits if quantitative analysis is required)
E.g. Color Tests (like Marquis Test – opiates (purple) , amphetamines (orange)
E.g. Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)


General observation: Visually similar samples (e.g. tablets with same shape, colour, size) are grouped together. Their physical form, length, diameter, weight and packaging are documented. Packaging materials such as masking tapes, plastic bags and straws can provide important *associative linkages* between drug packages and should be removed carefully for further examination.


Often, only part of the submitted items are sampled for analysis. The sampled items are pulverized and homogenized using a mortar and pestle, followed by a blender (if necessary).

The homogenized samples are subjected to microscopy, colour tests, microcrystal tests, immunoassay tests and/or thin layer chromatography to screen for the presence of controlled drugs.
*Color tests* are most commonly used as they are easy to use, relatively cheap and produce quick results.


For cannabis samples, the vegetative material is examined macroscopically and microscopically for biological features such as glandular hairs (trichomes) and the flowering and fruiting tops of the female cannabis plant.

1. Separation of intact branches from the compressed block
2. Macroscopic

- for rehabilitation in DRC or 
- prosecution for offence(s) under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

To provide testing of drugs of abuse in hair specimens – for supervision purpose


Does HSA urine test comply with the law? Challenge mounted in court.


## Metabolism
- Drugs are typically metabolised in the body after consumption
- Not all parent drugs can be detected in the urine
- Detection of parent drugs and metabolites depends a number of factors, e.g.
	- amount of drug consumed
	- metabolic and excretion rates
	- amount of water consumed
	- duration between the last consumption and urine procurement

Heroin is metabolized to *6-acetylmorphine* before morphine. The presence of 6-acetylmorphine is therefore indicative of heroin consumption. However, the detection time in urine is 2 to 8 hrs.

*Screening test*
A pair of locked security boxes containing the urine specimens are submitted to HSA.

Both first set and second set of urine specimens undergo the screening test, performed separately by 2 different laboratory officers

*Confirmatory test*

## The Cartel and the ugly truth
*DEA (drug enforcement administration)*
Drugs abuse is widespread in southeast Asia. Within it is the infamous ‘Golden Traingle’. Singapore, being near it, could easily become a transit centre or import market for drugs. The amount of opium poppy grown in Southeast Asia has nearly tripled since 2006

In 2021, the 3 most abused drugs in Singapore are methaphetamine (yaba), heroin and cannabis.

Node never has contact with any of the other nodes.

1. *New Psychoactive Substances*
	- K2 or “spice” (also known as synthetic cannabinoids like JWH-018), “bath salts” (mephedrone, MDPV) and other synthetic cathinones, hawaiian harvest
	- In recent years, the rapidly emerging use of new psychoactive substances (NPS), also known as “designer drugs”, “legal highs”, and “bath salts” have drawn global concern. These substances mimic the effects of illicit drugs
	- They are produced by modifying the chemical structure of controlled drug to circumvent drug controls.
	- The most reported category of NPS is synthetic cannabinoids, which mimic the effects of the main psychoactive substances in cannabis, *tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)*
	- NPS were added to the list of Class A controlled drugs in the First Schedule to the MDA on 1 May 2014.
	- paranoia, hallucinations, seisures and death

2. *Nacrotics*
	- Includes opium, opium derivatives and their semi-synthetic/totally synthetic substitutes. E.g. heroin, morphine, methadone, fentanyl. 
	- Uses: lessen pain by depressing the CNS
	- *Heroin* addict population grown to about 130,000. about below 30 years old. Common mode of administration was and still is, chasing the dragon (i.e. by heating the drug on aluminum foil and inhaling its fumes).
	- Operation Ferret launched: heroin abusers were identified by positive urine tests & detained for compulsory treatment and rehabilitation at Drug Rehabilitation Centre
	- Heroin No. 4 is white in color while No. 3 is yellowish in color
	- Common consumption method: injection, snorting lines of it in powdered form or smoking it (“chasing the dragon") by heating the heroin on aluminium foil and inhaling the smoke and vapours
	- Active ingredient: Diamorphone (purity 1-5%)
	- The infamous ‘Golden Triangle’ - located in an area where Burma, Laos and Thailand meet 
		- One of the largest illicit opium poppy-growing regions in the world
		- *Raw opium* is converted to *morphine base* at jungle refineries and clandestine laboratories and later processed into heroin.
		- Through Thailand and the surrounding countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, heroin finds its way into the Far East, Europe and the USA.

3. *Stimulants*
	- Includes amphetamine, methamphetamine, amphetamine variants (MDMA, MDA), cocaine.
	- Uses: stimulate the CNS, increase alertness, attention, energy. Induce sense of euphoria, improve mood.
	- *Methamphetamine*
	- Also known as: ice, glass, crystal, speed, ya ba, shabu, syabu, crazy horse pill.
	- Form: tablet, chunky crystaline substances, colourless crystals resembling glass fragments or shiny blue-white rocks of various sizes.
	- Common consumption method: oral consumption, injection, smoking.
	- Methods used to manufacture meth are directly impacted by the availability of precursor chemicals and ease of synthesis.
	- “Meth” is produced by utilising pseudoephedrine and common house-hold chemical products like anhydrous ammonia from fertilizers and lithium batteries, using the "one pot” method (the ingredients are mixed by shaking the container) and regulating the pressure created by the chemical reaction.
	- “Cooking meth” – & the chemical mixture could burst into flames when exposed to oxygen - can result in explosions and fires that could injure and kil
	- *Ecstasy*
	- Also known as: MDMA, MDEA, MDA. 
	- Form: tablets of various colours, shapes and sizes with different logos stamped on them.
	- Common consumption method: oral consumption
	- *Cocaine*
	- Also known as: crack, coke, snow. 
	- Form: crystalline powder. 
	- Common consumption method: sniffed in powder form or injection in liquid form.
	- Some drugs are stable and bind to the ink on the currency when used for handling drugs

4. *Hallucinogens*
	- Includes cannabis and semi-synthetic/synthetic like Lysergide (LSD), phencyclidine, psilocin, ketamine. 
	- Uses: Alter an individual’s perceptions and may result in illusions and sensory distortions.
	- Cannabis was brought into Singapore by Indian immigrant workers (commonly known as ‘ganja’) at about the same time as opium.
	- Abuse if cannabis became widespread among Malay youths and most common method of consumption was to smoke it with tobacco
	- CNB revealed that among new abusers, cannabis has replaced heroin as the second most abused drug in Singapore behind methamphetamine
	- “Other countries have, in recent years, decriminalised or legalised the use of cannabis, both for medical as well as recreational purposes. We will not do the same.”
		- Senior Minister of State (Home Affairs & National Development) Desmond Lee reinforced Singapore’s zero-tolerance stance against drugs at a United Nations 59th session of the Commission on Narcotics Drugs
	- *Cannabis*
	- Also known as marijuana, pot, grass, joints, ganja, hashish (resin), weed, sinsemilla.
	- “Cannabis mixture” means any mixture of vegetable matter containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabinol (CBN) in any quantity
	- Cannabis, THC (a cannabinol derivative) and CBN – All 3 are Class A Controlled Drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
	- Investigations revealed that he started smoking weed, a street name for cannabis, when he was first introduced to it during his JC days.
	- *Ketamine*
	- Also Known as: K, Special K, Vitamin K, Kit Kat. 
	- Form: White fine crystalline powder, liquid or tablet. 
	- Common consumption method: oral consumption, injection, consumed in drinks or added to cigarettes , sometimes mixed with other drugs like ecstasy tablets. 
	- Use as anesthetic.

5. *Depressants and Hypnotics*
	- Includes benzodiazepines like Valium,  Rohypnol (Roofies) GHB. Uses: Depress the CNS, resulting in Drowsiness and slowed responsiveness.
