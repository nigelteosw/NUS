## Forensic Human Identifiers##
Biological identifiers - blood, sweat
Concerns on CNA:
- conventional drugs
- NPS (New Psychoactive Substances)
- Normal substances can be a potential poison
	- Covid 19 medicine being bought online
- Raman spectrometer
	- Using light to identify chemicals 
	- Fast, non-invasive
	- ICA can use it to quickly and easily identify controlled substances
- Fingerprint is unique
	- DNA cannot tell between identical twins
	- Every Contact Leaves A Trace
	- Fingerprint are latent prints, cannot be seen with the naked eye
		- Requires enchancement through chemical methods
	- Natural secretions, sweat and oil
	- Touching a substance beforehand allows them to enhance the print, florescent lightsource 

What are the issues that are important?
1. Who is she? Passport was stolen by her pimp.
2. Her age? Minor

### Bertillonage Measurements###
- Using measurements to tell people apart

### Fingerprints, Footprints, Palmprints###
- Under Forensic Light Source
- Fingerprint Magnifier
- Not only the position of the palmprint but also the height and the action and the identity of the person

### Teeth###
- **BAD**
- **B**itemarks
- **A**ssault
- **D**isaster Victim Identification

**Stirling Road Murder: PP v Tharema Vejayan s/o Govindasamy**

-   Murdered his wife, Smaelmeeral Binte Abdul Aziz    
-   One of her tooth fell , block 181 sterling road 
-   Dragged her from the bus stop into the lift and can see blood stains
-   Already Low lying and bleeding heavily 
-   Bash her up along the corridor, pivoted her over and she died 
-   Blood was dripping from the 13th floor 
-   Odontology - a science dealing with the teeth, their structure and development, and their diseases
-   Tissue around her was still fresh - evidence presented by Tan 
Peng Hui

### DNA###
- Somethings DNA is not the silver bullet 
- CSI: The Experience at the Science Centre

### Biometrics###
- Iris scan
- Facial scan
- Forensic entomology (insects)
- Poison that has been ingested
- Person that has been burnt

## Forensic DNA Profilling###
- DNAscan Rapid DNA Analysis System
	- Only instrument that can churn out DNA in a quick manner
- Home Team Agency 

### DNA###
- Why use DNA in court?
- What is human DNA and how is it used in forensic science?
- The materials that genes are made from
- DNA may be called the **genetic blueprint**
- DNA is found in the nucleus of every cell except red blood cells
- A <-> T, G <-> C
- **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)** 
	- requires only a small amount of DNA template to gennerate sufficient product for development of a dna profile
	- DNA Amplicfication 
- DNA may be obtained from evidence which contain saliva **(which contain buccal cells)**, sweat (which contain skin cells).

**What does the law say?**
Body sample
- Sample of blood
- Sample of head hair, including roots
- Swab taken from persons mouth
- Such other sample

Registeration of **Criminals** Act
- For example, finger impressions from crime scenes are matched against finger impressions recorded in the Register, thus helping the police to **narrow** the list of suspects. The court also makes use of these criminal records when sentencing a repeat offender.
- Body samples, such as blood, **semen** and tissue samples, found at the crime scenes can be used to profile the DNA of the person to whom the body sample belongs. Through a DNA database of criminals, Police will be able to determine if a body sample found at the crime scene belongs to an ex-criminal.
- When a suspect is found, it will also enable the Police to match the DNA profile with that of the suspect to narrow down the list of crime suspects. This is especially useful in investigating crimes with very few **leads** for the police to work on.”

### Forensic DNA Profiling###
Polymorphism: Individualisation based on **differences** between one’s DNA profile from another’s DNA profile, i.e. variation in DNA amongst individuals

Short Tandem Repeats(STR) = Identical units of DNA sequence
The NUMBER of STR at the one chromosome site. (locus **genetic marker**) can vary amongst individuals

**Amelogenin** test as a gender determinnant
Match

ABI Globalflier KIt: simultaneous amplification at 21 STR loci + 2 Y-loci + amelogenin

**1985: Ghana Immigration Case (Alec Jeffreys)**
- Without DNA forensics technique, cannot tell if son is the actual son without genetic test.
**1986: Colin Pitchfork Double Murder Case**
- Exonerated
**1991: Singapore police force started to use DNA Forensics**
- In the 1997 case of Public Prosecutor v Tay Wee Guan, where the accused was charged for rape, the forensic DNA test carried out in Singapore was only for one genetic locus **DS180**; and the DNA test accordingly had a low discriminating power.
**2004: Singapore Police Force DNA database launched**
**2011: FBI expanded STR loci to 20 STRs**

Kastle-Meyer Test: Positive results **(pink)** indicate the need for further tests

Hexagon OBTI test = when positive, proves that **human blood** is actually present.

This was supported by the forensic findings that the deceased's and the accused's fingernail clippings were stained with each other’s **DNA**.

- The deceased’s body was recovered from Whampoa River with her head and hands missing.
- The police managed to confirm her identity after officers obtained her DNA sample from one of her belongings at her workplace; and was found to **match** the DNA samples taken from her body.
- Question: What was her belonging which contained the deceased’s DNA?

- In the case of Murugesan v Public Prosecutor the accused was convicted of abduction and committing rape on the victim. However, he alleged that it was his accomplice who had tried to have intercourse with the victim.
- Yet, an **incriminating** piece of evidence was a semen stain found on the victim's underwear that matched his DNA profile, thus contradicting his claims.
- In the end, though, the conviction against him was upheld.

Examine swabs for Spermatozoa; and two proteins: Semenogelin & Prostate-Specific Antigen (**PSA**). Concordant detection of both proteins is indicative of the presence of **semen**.

### Dead Man Walking###
- In an interesting case which the media called "Dead Man Walking", DNA profiling was used to solve the **insurance scam** of a man who faked his death.
- On 15 October 2007, Gandaruban s/o Subramaniam ("Gandarubann") with the name of Arumugam Vivekananthan entered Singapore using his Sri Lanka passport.
- He was arrested at Changi International Airport and the insurance scam which had its beginnings in 1987 entered its concluding chapter.
- DNA profiling confirmed that Renuga's youngest son, who was conceived after Gandaruban purportedly died, and his older siblings shared the same biological father

- In 1995, the UK developed the first known DNA criminal investigative database known as **NDNAD** (National DNA Database).
- The national DNA Database in USA is the Combined DNA Index System **(CODIS)**. 
	- A suspect's DNA profile would be compared against all existing profiles in the database once it is uploaded. This is particularly useful in surfacing **repeat offenders**, and for the matching of crime scenes and persons to crime scenes, especially during the investigation of crimes with very few leads.

1996 
- In the deceased’s flat, the accused quarrelled with the deceased; took out a nail clipper from his jeans and stabbed her neck repeatedly. He cleaned her bloodstains from his shoes, wiped fingerprints off the table and threw away the ash tray they were using. But he forgot the **10 cigarrette butts** he had dumped on some newspaper in the flat.
2003
- With the new DNA database coming up, the Police sent the 10 cigarette butts to HSA for profiling.
2004
- Accused was convicted for a drug offence & his DNA sample was taken His DNA was found to **match** the DNA obtained from the cigarette butts.

Public Prosecutor v Sashi Kumar
10 March 2005
- 18- year-old student nearly raped and assaulted in Clementi
11 March 2005
- 20-year-old student sodomised at Ulu Pandan Connector

His DNA matched: 
(i) DNA from the semen found on the 69-year-old victim, 
(ii) DNA from the tissue samples on an earring he dropped while attempting to rape the 18-year-old; and 
(iii) DNA from the epithelial cells lifted off the 20-year-old’s clothes

**The Grim Sleeper Serial Killer Case**

### Evidentiary Value ###
- A DNA match between the suspect's sample and the sample from the crime scene does not automatically guarantee a conviction.
- Although DNA is a very strong piece of evidence, it is often not enough to convict someone of a particular crime.
- It must always be taken in conjunction with other pieces of evidence and the **weight** of DNA evidence is impossible to estimate without taking into account the circumstances of the case.
  
- DNA is prone to **contamination** and **degradation** if not handled and/or stored properly.
- This will decrease the **evidentiary value** of the DNA evidence
- DNA evidence can also be transferred from one object to another, otherwise known as **"secondary transfer"**
- An interesting study found that spermatozoa could be transferred from one pair of semen-stained panties to other pristine items by machine washing.

Wet container encourages the spread of bacteria. This caused degredation of DNA.

Multitude of factors affecting transfer of epithelial (skin) cells 
	 –  Substrate (porous v non-porous)
	 – Duration and nature of contact (vigorous v Incidental) 
	 – Shedder status (good v poor) 
	 – Activity (e.g. Washing of hands, contact with other sources immediately prior to touching the exhibit) 
	 – Conditions – uv, heat, bacterial growth, humidity, washing

	- can be found in much higher numbers

Non-DNA identifying information includes any description of the individual, such as a person's sex, age, appearance and height, as well as any document that contains information that identifies the individual. Ultimately, expanding the databases serves the public interest as the data is useful in helping the police solve crimes, exonerate the innocent and identify the culprit, said MHA.

“Blood samples yield more DNA than other types of body sample, and are hence more useful for DNA comparison,” MHA said

DNA is not present in red blood cells but in white blood cells.
