## Deep-dive into FDE

### Forensic Document Examination
- Albert S. Osborn (1858 – 1946) is regarded as a pioneer in FDE.
- His book "Questioned Documments", which was first published in 1910, revised in 1929, is still regarded as one of the authoritative textbooks on forensic document examination today.
- In 1942, he founded and became the first president of the *American Society of Questioned Document Examiners (ASQDE)* the oldest and largest organization in the world dedicated to the profession of FDE.
  
- Famous cases such as the 1932 Lindbergh baby kidnapping case placed handwriting expert evidence in the limelight.
- Alborn’s testimony on the handwriting of the ransom note played a key role in the conviction of Bruno Richard Hauptmann.
- FDE started to be used in Singapore around the same time.
  
- In the 1938 Singapore Court of Appeal case of Yeo Hock Cheng v Rex, the forensic document examiner testified that the two letters were written by the accused who murdered the deceased.
- The examiner had “for many years given expert evidence on handwriting in the Courts of this Colony.”

### What is a document?
- A document records the terms and conditions of our interaction with people in the society. A document carries information of our past actions and our future plans.
- Integrity of document is the point of contention in civil and criminal litigation.
- Substrate: paper, wall, woodwork, mirror, dust bin, human body or on any other physical object of any size.
- Production: 
	- *handwritten* by ink, paint, markers, brushes, spray cans, lipsticks, blood
	- *printed* by home-office printer e.g. ink-jet printer, laser printer, or by large-scale industrial printer e.g. offset printer

### 3-Fold Roles of a Forensic Document Examiner
- To coundct scientific examination of a document.
- To intepret and report the findings objectively.
- To provide impartial expert opinion to the court.

### Scope of FDE Services in Singapore

- Examination of handwriting and signatures in English, Chinese and Romanised scripts.
- Examination of tampered and counterfeit documents.
- Differentiation of inks
- Visualisation of indented writing
- Identification of stamps and stamp impressions
- Physical fitting of torn/cut documents
- Examination of printing, photocopies, typewritten and facsimile documents.

**HSA's Forensic Chemistry and Physics Lab**
- Handwritings, Signatures, Tampered and Counterfeit documents, Indented writings

### What is Handwriting?
- A complex perceptual-motor behavior carried out by most members of the population.
- Individuals generally taught a system of writing usually based on copy books.
- As individuals practise writing, they develop their own writing habits, which manifest in the form of individualistic characteristics in the handwriting.

### Handwriting and Signature Examination
- Forensic handwriting and signature examination is about the question of authorship
	- Did Mr LEe sign the will?
	- Did Jack write the "O\$P$" note on the wall? 
	- Did Jill sign the business contract?
	- Did John Doe write the suicide note?
- Can I tell from his handwriting that he is an aggressive person? NO
- NOT Graphology.
- Graphology is the inference of personality or character from the handwriting or signature and has no scientific basis.

### Basis of Examination
- Handwriting characteristics (habits) of a person are repetitive.
- No two persons write exactly alike.
- No one persons writes exactly the same way each time -> natural variation.
- Each person develops a level of writing skill that cannot be exceeded.

### Combination of features such as:
![[Pasted image 20220926193738.png]]

"The way you write, the stroke quality, the pen pressure used, the pen emphasis, the formation of the letters or numerals are all unique to the individual." - Mr Yap Bei Sing, HSA’s Consultant Forensic Scientist.

### How does forensic document examiner examine handwriting?
- By comparing the distinguishing key features of questioned with specimens:
	- Line spacing
	- Slant and slope of writing
	- Formation (construction)
	- Relative alignment of letters, characters, numerals
	- Fluency
	- Pen pressure
- Slant and slope are two characteristics that refer to the inclination of the writing with respect to the vertical and horizontal margins respectively
- Line quality refers to the combination of writing speed, skill, freedom of movement , execution of rhythm and pen pressure.
- Relative allignment of strokes includes the proportion of letters, and the relative height and positioning of one letter to another. For e.g. “d” – short staff or long staff.
- Formation means how letters are formed or constructed. This includes the sequence of strokes, shape and size of loops, curvature of strokes. For eg. ”t” (vertical stroke then horizontal stroke, or vice versa).
- Fluency, which refers to the degree of free-flowing penstroke movement, continuity of line and naturalness in the writing.

### How do we examine handwriting?
- Compare like with like:
	- block letters with block letters
	- small letters with small letters (letter ‘a’ with letter ‘a’) 
	- cursive with cursive 
	- numbers with numbers 
	- Chinese character with chinese character
	- "John" vs "Peter" "234" vs "196840"


### ACE approach
- The questioned documents (authenticity is doubtful) and known specimens are analysed for their characteristics.
- The two sets of documents are compared for similarities and/or differences in characteristics.
- The FDE then evaluates the significanceof the similarities and/or differences in order to reach a conclusion.

- convex shape of "t-a" connecting stroke
- concave shape of "t-e" connectings stroke
- relative opsition of the eyelet of "e" in "t" and "e"
- relative slant of "S" to "y"
- upward slant of t-bar
- shape of y-trough
- slant of d-loop
- relative height of the top of the d-loop
- relative size of "AP" to the box
- relative spacing between "8" and "6" compared with that between "6" and "3" in "836"

### Factors affecting handwriting production
- Physical exhaustion. 
- Illnesses, injuries, medication. 
- Advanced in age. 
- State of mind: nervous, angry, etc.
- Influence of drugs, alcohol
- Writing instrument, transfer medium, surface/support.
- Writing posture, environment
- Space available, location on the document
- Writing purpose
- Disguise


### Signatures
- Particularly important in modern age of email and telephone
- Most individual, but not much writing.
	- Look at your signature
	- Look at two other persons' signatures
- Conditions associated with signing: use of different writing media, haste of signing, physical exhaustion, illness, injuries, old age, under influence of drugs and/or alcohol.


### Basis of Signature Identification
- A signature with which one identifies oneself exhibits many personal writing habits and ability in respect of pen lifts, pen pressure, line quality, slant and relative alignment of strokes to printed features like stamp impressions and dotted line.
- Signatures of a person are certain to bear a strong resemblance to one another.
- No two signatures of a person are perfect replicas of each other.


### Types of Forged Signaures
- Traced forgeries:
	- Forged signatures produced by tracing a genuine signature.
	- no fluency;
	- tracing marks, guiding lines may be evident
- Simulated forgeries:
	- Signatures written by free-hand copying a genuine signature.
	- Difference in pen pressure, fluency, slant, relative height and spacing of strokes
	- Evidence of touching up,, overwriting
- Photocopied or computer-printed forgeries:
	- Forgeries produced by photocopyinng or computer scanning and printing

### Nick Leeson, trader at Barings Bank
- Unauthorised speculative, risky trading
- Scale of his losses: 827 million poinds
- Single handedly brought down Barings Bank
- Photocopy signature - raised but not idented


### Features used in Detection of Forged Signatures
- *Tracing marks.*
- Stroke (line) fluency. 
- Slant, tilt of strokes.
- Size of signature
- Pen lifts
- Stroke (line) fluency. 
- Slant, tilt of strokes.
- Relative alignment of strokes
- Relative alignment with underline, stamp impression, etc. 
- *Photocopied forgery?*


### Forgery/Disguise
- Need to discard own writing habits AND imitate another person’s characteristics.
- May not notice all the details
- Hard to maintain fluency AND accuracy at the same time


### Conclusion Levels
- How characteristic a person’s handwriting / signature is
- The quality of the submission
	- original documents
	- adequacy of speciments for comparison
- The amount of questioned writing / signature.


### Conclusion Levels
1. The writer of this wrote that.
2. It is highly probable that the writer...
3. It is probable that the writer…
4. The possibility of the writer ... cannot be ruled out
5. The evidence is inconclusive
6. There is no evidence to indicate that the writer...
7. It is unlikely that the writer...
8. The writer of this did not write that


### Limitations
- Insufficient specimens

### Ms Nellie Cheng
- A pair of eyes that is good at picking up details.
- A pair of hands that is skillful and careful in handling exhibits.
- A mind that is open to learning new techniques and technologies.
- And most importantly, a heart that is dedicated to serve the administration of justice
  
- Ms Nellie Cheng, forensic Scientist, expertise in FDE/questioned document examination. This includes examination of handwriting, signatures, ink, paper, printings, stamps and stamp impressions. Her findings have been and will be used to serve the administration of justice.
- “The job of a forensic scientist is important. Without document examination, this means some evidence, however important to the investigation and judgement, cannot speak.
- One misconception is that authorship can be ascertained within minutes or at a glance. When a FDE compares handwriting features, examination generally takes days to complete.


- Original in unaltered condition (i.e. not copy)
- Preserve and protect fingerprints, trace evidence - use sheet protector
- Submit sufficient standard writing (i.e. controls



### Handling, Collection & Submission of Exhibits
- FDE’s results and conclusions depend very much on the *quality* of the evidence and *adequacy* of speciments submitted.


### Handwriting & Signature Specimens
**Original documents**
- Reproduced copies may not show pen pressure and other details of strokes, different colours of inks, tracing marks, signs of physical cut-and-paste etc.
- Lack of originals may affect conclusions


Determine the of 

**Normal Specimens**
- Known writings/signatures made during normal course of work
- e.g. diary, bank cheque, greeting card, address book, post-it note, application form
- Handwriting of similar nature made in the past at the material time of the offence (at or about or contempraneous with questioned writing

**Request Specimens**
- Specimens made on request for the purpose of comparison.

### Detection of Counterfeit Documents
By examination of
- Security features
- Paper
- Printing processes


- By examination of Paper:
- Cotton paper (used for banknotes), wood pulp-based paper.
- Weight (grams per square meter), thickness (mm)
- Paper fibres pattern
- brighteners, adhesives, binding materials, additives, etc.).
- Watermark
- Manufacturing markings e.g. cut marks, striations



### Tampering
Addition
Alteration
Obliterations
Overwriting 
Erasures
Substitution

Erasure (by mechanical or chemical)
- Microscopic Examination: damage to paper
- Chemical separation and comparison of ink pigment components


### Stamps
- Class Characteristics:
- Individual Characteristics
	- Features acquired through use of the stamp, accumulation of paper fibres, ink, dirt, cracks and splits in the rubber material.


### 
Challenges:
Genuine stamp impression à scan à acquire image to duplicate stamp à make forged stamp impression.
- Association may not be successful
- Very simple in design
- Few or no individual characteristics to compare with



- Writing made on a piece of paper resting on another will leave impressions on the latter.
- Writing impressions may be useful in: 
- Linking documents to the same origin. 
- Providing proof of source in anonymous writing cases. 
- Providing evidence of page. substitution/removal
- Establishing the order in which writings on different pages were written.

**Age determination:**


A piece of written text may be exposed as fraudulent, if it can be demonstrated that the ink used only have became commercially available after the date on which the document purports to have been written.

### The Hitler Diaries
- Three separate forensic documents made comparison between the diaries and specimen samples of what was believed to be Hitler’s handwriting.
- However, investigations revealed that the handwriting samples provided for comparison had in fact been written by the same forger – Konrad Kujau – who also produced the diaries.
- Other evidence included whitening substance found on the papers (these substances were used only in/after 1954, and Hitler already passed away in 1954); the inks of the handwriting on one of the diaries were less than a year old (which were supposed to be made in 1943) at the time of the examination.
