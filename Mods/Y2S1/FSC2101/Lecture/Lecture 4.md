## Deep-dive into BPA (Blood Pattern Analysis)###

### PIDC: Bloodstain Evidence###
- Wear P**P**E including gowns and gloves
- **I**dentify the evidence: 
	- placard and tapes
- **D**ocument the evidence: 
	- including forensic photography, sketch plans notes
- **C**ollection of evidence: 
	- swab and dry container

Gravity and seriousness of injury?
Who was bleeding
Direction of blood - where was the person heading to
The position of the bloodstain will indicate the movements of the accused

1) Presumptive test for blood
2) Confirmatory test for human blood
3) Forensic DNA profile

The examination of the location, size, shape and distribution of bloodstains and bloodstain patterns.

To provide information on the event or a sequence of events that resulted in the deposition of the bloodstains or bloodstain patterns.

in association with knowledge of the underpinning sciences (including physics, mathematics and biology)

Documentation of crime scene:
3d imaging device
compact image scanner to detect fingerprints
Blood mist indicates a high level of presure was applied on the victim

## Properties of Blood##
Viscosity, which is a fluid's resistance to flow.

Surface tension, which is a force that holds a liquid together and pulls a falling drop into a spherical shape.

Biological properties of blood:
- DNA analysis
- ABO blood typing
- Toxicology test

Physical properties of blood:
- Resulting bloodstains can be the key to recnstructing what happened and in what sequence

Relative positions of the victim and the assailant.
The truthfulness of victim, suspects, witnesses.

Type of object used. 
The direction from which the object struck the victim.

Origin of bloodstains.

Locations and movements of the victim and/or assailant.

The number of blows delivered.

### Why Study BPA###
Adult male has about 5-6 litres of blood and adult female has about 4-5 litres of blood, in many instances of violent crimes, copious amount of blood can be found at the crime scene. 

For a crime committed indoor, the walls, floors and even ceilings may all show evidence of bloodstains.

Search of the scene, carried out with good **light source**, should be extensive and thorough.

As with all types of physical evidence, all bloodstains present should be **documented** (notes, sketches, photographs and/or video footages).

### Forensic Photography###
Purpose of crime scene photography: 
- Provides linkages between different pieces of exhibit

Close-up, examination quality photographs to document pattern evidence

### How does luminol react to produce light?###

- When blood is present, the luminol is oxidized and as a result, a distinct **blue glow** is produced. This luminescence may be viewed and photographed under **darkened** conditions.

- The luminol test is especially useful when the crime scenes have been washed to remove any obvious bloodstains. In the Orchard body parts case of PP v Aguilar Guen, the accused dismembered the deceased, pack the body parts, dispose of them and clean up the crime scene. A significant amount of bloodstains on the wall in her bedroom had been wiped away, leaving only a few **spatter** stains. Luminol was able to chemically enhance the invisible traces of blood to reveal them sufficiently for photo-documentation and presence of transfer patterns.

## PP vs Aguilar Guen##
- The accused pleaded guilty, chopped up the parts then dumped them near the Orchard MRT station
- The High Court Judge noted her "clumsy" attempt to clean up the crim scene
- The deceased blood was found at the crime scene
- Question: how do u know it was blood, and how the blood belonged to the deceased?

## PP vs Eu Lim Hoklai (EHL)##
- The accused suffered 9 stab wounds.
- Forensic scientist Ms Lim Chin Chin opined that the accused’s wounds were **self-inflicted**.
- She debunked his claim that he was knifed by the deceased Yu before he killed her: “They were in very close proximity and there should be blood spatter on her if she stabbed him. The **absence** of blood spatter on her indicated that she very likely did not stab him.
- Further, all 9 stab wounds were on the accused’s **abdomen**, and typically in a struggle, slashes and stab wounds would be all over the body.

## Public Prosecutor v Kamal Bin Kupli and Others ##
Type of object used. The direction from which the object struck the victim.

## Limitations of BPA: ##
- Some patterns may be due to more than one activity.
- May have been created after the incident e.g. during removal of body from scene.
- May appear similar to one another but are from **different**
- Previous, **unrelated** bloodshed
- Numerous, complex or unusual patterns make it difficult to form an opinion.
- Insufficient pattern information.
- Bloodstain pattern on clothing worn by deceased could have been **altered**.
- Lack of information from other examinations e.g. DNA.
- Circumstances of the examination e.g. based on photos.
- (Obviously) the analyst was not there when it happened. (**opinion** based on interpretation of patterns)

## Four main principles of bioethics##
Autonomy
Beneficence
Non-maleficence
Justice

Intepretion of patterns = opinion evidence

## 3 Main Caegories of Bloodstaions##
1) Projected/Active Bloodstains
- Defined as those caused by blood that has been made to travel by force other than that of gravity.
- Bloodstains of this type may arise in different ways – for e.g. they may occur as a result of impact to the victim’s body by the assailant, such as use of fist, foot, weapon (such as hammer, baseball bat, stick).
- Bloodstains caused by impact usually take the form of a spatter pattern, in which numerous small droplets of blood are dispersed over the target surface. The greater the force, the smaller the bloodstains.

**Low velocity**
- Gravity is the only force acting on the blood (e.g. dripping patterns)
**Medium velocity**
- Moderate force from some object causes pooled blood to “scatter” in all directions surrounding the contact (e.g. Use of blunt force to a bleeding source, or someone stomping his shoe into pooled blood)
**High velocity**
- Extreme force acting on a blood source (e.g. gunshots, Explosions, high impact forces of a vehicle crash)

Cast-off stains
Blood may be flung off
distributed along a line

- Another type of active bloodstain is caused by the projection of pressurised blood onto a surface.
- This occurs most notably when an artery is breached and the heart continues to pump.
- The volume of blood issuing from a punctured artery under pressure may be relatively large (known as **gushes**), or relatively small (known as **spurts**)

**Expirated** blood: Typically formed by a person suffering from a serious head wound or internal injury, coughing or sneezing blood droplets onto nearby surfaces, creating a pattern of distinct small stains or spots.

**Arterial** spurt pattern produced by victim who sustained a severed right carotid artery.
   
2) Contact Transfer Bloodstain 
- Transfer bloodstains are those that have been deposited on surfaces as a result of **direct contact** with objects contaminated with wet blood
- contact
- It may also help to establish the movement of the individuals involved

3) Passive Bloodstains
Defined as those that are formed solely under the **influence of gravity**

**Blood dripping into blood:** produced by single drop of blood falling 36 inches onto smooth cardboard.
Note the extent of the **satelite** around the parent or central stain.

Blood Drip
Blood Saturation Stains
- Accumulation of liquid blood in an absorbent material.
Blood Pool
- An accumulation of liquid blood on a surface

Flow
Movement of a volume of blood on a surface due to gravity or movement of the target.

### Type of Artefacts###
1) Regurgitate
2) Defeactory
3) Translocation
4) Larval Stains

## Forensic Entomology##
Provide vital clues with the 3 different motis
indication/estimation of post mortem interval (when did the person pass away)
different stages of decomposition produces different odour 
insects detect decaying flesh
depends on other signs as well, in totality it will be essential to tell the court when did the event occur
maggots and flies on the wounds can tell what happened to the person before his death.
What type of trauma the person has suffered.

## Cracking a case - what's the silver bullet here?##
**Directionality:** a characteristic of a bloodstain that indicates the direction blood was moving at the time of decomposition

Bloodstaions showing **diameter** of travel

The **shape** of a blood splater indicates the **angle** from which it **impacted** the surface.

Measure the **width** and the **length** of the droplet.

Use of a **protractor** with the calculated angle of impact to determine the area of origin of a bloodstain.

Determine the area of **origin**.

### Trace Evidence The Case Files of Dr. Henry Lee###
Hilo a big island in the sleepy side of Hawaii
1 car accident
they did not investigate enough
the police department did not seem to put enough effort into it
Where was the physical evidence on the outside of the van
Body has been cremated before they could find evidence on it
Van returned to Ken Mathison
Did not see damage on the van, negative evidence
Undercarriage of the van found human blood
Blood stains that was very unique within the van
Swipe pattern caused during a struggle
How did the blood get onto the instrument panel
Yvonne was in the drivers seat and struck 4 times
She said she was not gonna be alive before christmas
Noticed some pattern that was unclear so they had to enhance it


motive, violent struggle

- This case is known as the Mathison murder case, which occurred in Hilo, Hawaii. 
- On 27 Nov 1992, Sergeant Kenneth Mathison of the Hawaii Police Department and his wife Yvonne were travelling north in their van on the Volcano Highway. 
- According to Sgt Mathison, they were involved in an argument and she suddenly jumped from the moving van. After that, he drove the van to look for her. He told the first responding officer that he found her lying on the road edge, apparently having been struck by an unknown vehicle. 
- He later changed his version, and stated that while looking for his wife that dark rainy night, he felt a bump, got out of his van and realised that he had run her over with the van
  
- Yvonne was conveyed to a hospital where she was pronounced dead as a result of her injuries. She suffered a *severe skull fracture* and had a corresponding laceration on the left side of her head. 
- The autopsy revealed that the skull fracture was consistent with a *perpendicular blow*, rather than an injury associated with having been run over by a passing vehicle. She had a broken forearm. 
- There was a tire impression on her left chest corresponding to a tire mark from the van that would be expected if she had been run over by the van.
  
- Initially, the case was investigated as fatal traffic accident. 
- On 7 May 1993, at Prosecutor Kurt Spohn’s request, Dr Henry Lee travelled to Hilo to conduct a detailed examination of the van. 
- Dr Lee found bloodstain patterns and other evidence that were inconsistent with Sgt Mathison’s story. 
- Some of the key findings by Dr Lee are as follows: 
	- Multiple bloody hair swipe on the driver’s side sun visor shows that these patterns are the result of contact and transfer from the victim’s head

- Hundreds of medium velocity impact blood spatters were found on the face of the instrument panel, suggesting multiple impacts.
