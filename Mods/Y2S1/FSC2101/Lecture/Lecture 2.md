### Sunny Ang v. PP (1965-1968) ###
- Insured Jenny against several insurance companies
- Renewing one of her policies for another five days
- Did not renew his own policies
- Sunny's mother as the beneficiary
- Jenny had little or no experience in diving
- He allowed her to goes into the dangerous waters alone
- Heels of one of her flippers was severed by a knife
	- Very important physical evidence
- Sunny showed a lack of urgency when Jenny did not surface
- Less than 24hrs he went to make the insurance claims

### Circumstancial Evidence ###
- Cumulative effect of all the evidence
- All the evidence leads to only 1 conclusion

### Direct Evidence ###
- When witnesses come to court to testify
- Eyewitness accounts

### Oh Laye Koh v. PP (1995) ###
- Boarded the schoolbus but failed to return home in the afternoon at 1.20pm
- Oh Laye Koh said that she was not there waiting for his bus
- 12 days later her body was found in an empty plot in Yishun
- Perfect match of the video image of the skill and the photograph 
- Evidence of trauma but unsure if it could be caused by a blunt object or a fall
- Oh Laye Koh lied that he was at the workshop to fix the brakes of his bus
- He asked the mechanic to lie about his whereabouts
- He called a student at a school and told her to lie that Shan Shan did not board his bus


### Court Proceedings ###
Innocent until proven guilty
- initial charges acquitted for the murder due to insufficient evidence
- Prosecution appealed to bring the case back for rehearing
- Now he is required to defend himself/testify
	- In SG the judge can draw an adverse inference against you
- Shan Shan's death was established not to be suicidal
- All based on circumstancial evidence

### Nadasan Chandra Secharan v. PP (1997) 
- **First use of DNA evidence (being challenged)**
- Victim had 13 stab wounds to the face and head, multiple fractures in the jaw, ribs, right humerous and pelvic region
	- No defensive injuries

### The Prosecution's Case###
- Stabbed her repeatedly
- Fractures caused by running his van over her body
- Afterwards went to the teple and attempted to wash the incriminating evidence from his van

- **Tyre** marks marked Nadasan's van
- **DNA** from a tooth fragment found under the floorboard of his van
- **Pieces of jewellery** worn by Ramipiran were found in the back of the van.
- **Nadasan's claim** that he took 1hr to repair his van's filter

- Tyre marks were not conclusive: the match possibility was stated as 1 to 133
- The fact that the tooth is there may not be surprising
- DNA extracted test only used 4 genetic loci
	- Now using 24 genetic loci with 1 gender marker
- DNA expert concluded that it was 3200 times more likely that the tooth fragment origniated from the victim
- The UK expert was very obnoxious in court
- Tooth fragment was from opening bottles with her tooth
- Jewellery items were so common that could not reliably point to the victim
- Raining and it was hard for him to repair his van

### Evaluation ###
- DNA evidence was still at an early stage
- Forensic evidence is capable of more than one interpretation

### PP v. Wang Wenfeng (2012)###

- Fast decompostion due to wild dogs
	- Cause of death was not ascertainable
