Michael Faraday - Fire
Glow because of white body radiation
Blue - hottest
Orange - Middle cooler
Glowing soot - Carbon glowing orange


Gravity pulls cool denser air down, hot air rises giving the flame its shape.

Fire cannot be stored
Fire is not matter at all, just a sensory perception to a chemical reaction

Fuel Heat and Oxygen
Cell walls decomposition

Type of molecules determine the color of the flame. calcium chloride, pottasium chloride, copper.

Iron loses electrons to oxygen and becomes rusty
Exothermic reactions gives out heat

3 Things needed to start a fire:
1. Fuel
2. Oxygen
3. Heat

5 Things to maintain a fire:
1. Ignition
2. Chain reaction
3. Fuel
4. Oxygen 
5. Heat


Color of the flame is an indicator of how how the flame is
Frequency of visible light changes the color

Its not the fire that kills the person, but carbon monoxide. When no access to oxygen, a person will axyphiate due to carbon monoxide poisoning.

Oxygen and fuel are in gaseous state, methane hydrogen are all very flamable

Helium not flamable

Add heat to cause a solid to break up and release molecules into the air

## Investigating Suspicious Fire

*Fire Point* 
- the temperature at which there is enough heat to cause combustion without a source of ignition
*Flash Point* 
- lowest temperature at which a liquid produces enough vapor to be ignited by a small flame

*Pyrolysis*
- Solid fuels has to be converted into a gaseous state before they can take part in flaming combustion
- When solid fuel is heated sufficiently, it breaks down into smaller molecules that are vaporisable

Set fire to body to get rid of the body.


*Burn patterns*
- the inverted-cone pattern which is a strong indication of the point of origin

*Accidental causes*
- electrical short circuit, lightning strike, negligent cooking, smoking in bed etc.

*Ignitable liquid residue*
- if an accelerant is used, it may not be completely consumed by the fire and traces may be detected
- *Pyrolysis* may convert solid fuel into carbon and activated carbon is an effective absorbent for ignitable liquid
- *Sniffers* a device that detects high amounts of ignitable liquid vapor


*Laboratory Analysis Testing*
for the presence of hydrocarbon; indicates presence of petroleum based accelerants

*Steam distillation Sample*
debris are heated and the steam is collected and condensed; the liquid is tested

*Heated Headspace Sample*
debris in a closed container is heated releasing vapour rich gas above the material in the headspace; the vapour is removed with a syringe and tested

*Vapour Concentration Sample*
debris is heated in a closed container with charcoal or activated carbon strips; Strips are removed and a solvent is added to extract the hydrocarbons

*Solvent Extraction*
A solvent such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride etc is added to the sample debris; solution is separated and analysed

*Instrumentation Gas chromatograph(GC)*  will separate the hydrocarbons into their components and they are tested against known standards; GC combined with mass spectroscopy GC/MS or infrared spectroscopy GC/IR will give a molecular fingerprint of the substance


Bukit Merah murder case
28 May 2002 10.40pm
Blk165 Bukit Merah Central

2 separate points of fire origin
1 in office
1 in play pen

Among the items found is US currency and 
2 mobile phones
Taxi ride and petrol from a kiosk
Girl died from stab wounds in the chest

Taken cab to petrol station, taxi driver helped her pay for her petrol
CCTV recording from the petrol station
- maid buying petrol

bite marks from 3 year old daughter
Found blood and petrol on the maid Sundarti

Sundarti cannot be interviewed

24th September sent to life imprisonment

2 capital charges is unfair to him
- which murder charge do they want to proceed on
- both were murdered in the same place and time
- both are quite different
- proceed against Angie Poh, not a good move


*Angieâ€™s injuries:* 
- Two stab wounds on her neck 
- A series of deep and gaping incised wounds across her left forearm, wrist and hand 
- Muscles, tendons, nerves and blood vessels were cut 
- Fracture of the left wrist joint with near dismemberment of left hand 
- Several incised wounds on right arm and right hand 
- already dead when the fire started

*COD:* accute haemorrhage due to incised right common carotid artery caused by stab wound to the neck

Petrol is very flamable in gaesous state, she burnt herself

Bite marks from Crystal who was stabbed twice in the chest.


Forensic odontology -> often heavily criticized 
but in this case can only 3 people could have been there

The maid was carrying the daughter when the daugther attacked the maid. The maid then stabbed her (possible scenario)


Dr Gilbert Lau, stab wounds impossible to be self inflicted.

When people spin a story, they are not consistent.
She claimed Angie ill treated her
Angie was in a trance and tried to kill her
