## Forensic Analysis of Fingerprints

### Historical Development
- Developing a reliable means to identify individuals
- DNA is now the premium method of identifing individuals
- In the past they used racism, then switched to Bertillon Cards
- In 1853, Sir William Herschel in Bengal took his own fingerprints over a period of 50 years to show that the ridge patterns do not change.
- First case it was used was in Argentina in 1892 involving the murder of the illegitimate children by their mother, Rojas.
- The case of People v. Jennings is considered a landmark decision which established fingerprints as reliable evidence in the US.

**Two crucial features:**
1) Principle of permanence
2) Principle of uniqueness

**Three principal structural elements of skin:**
1) The adherence of the epidermis cells to each other.
2) The basal cell level of the epidermis and its attachment to the basement membrane.
3) Attachment of dermis to the basement membrane through small anchoring fibers.

- **Principle of uniqueness:** 
- At around 10-10½ weeks Estimated Gestational Age (“EGA”), basal cells of the epidermis begin to divide rapidly. 
- Initial formation of primary ridges begins at about 10½ until about 16 weeks EGA. 
- Placement of second level details governed by interdependent stresses, strains, and tensions across that particular area of skin at the crucial moment when generated. 
- Timing of growth and regression of volar pads will affect cellular proliferation and ridge formation

- Because of the infinite number of factors that can affect the *ridges (raised portions)* and *furrows (depressed portions)*. 
- They form unique ridge patterns which are referred to as *“friction ridge characteristics” or ”FRC”.*

Blood will be in the furrow, but the ridges will leave the fingerprint.

### Collection of Fingerprints
**Physical Methods**
- Classic way, using black powder dusting and tape lifting
- *Magnetic brush* technique, use of magnetic powder which is less abrasive
	- Does not work on metalic surfaces
- *Small particle reagent* (SPR) technique: formulation of molybdenum suspended in a detergent solution that is commonly use on wet surfaces or items recovered from water

**Chemical Methods**
- *Ninhydrin* reacts with amino acids producing bluish-purple fingerprints; heat and humidity will accelerate the process.
	- Works well for porous surfaces.
- *Iodine crystals* will react with the lipid components (naturally occurring molecules containing hydrocarbons) giving the ridge features a dirty-brown colour appearance; must be photographed quickly before iodine vaporised.
- *Cyanoacrylate* (super glue) will vaporise with gentle heating and the fumes will polymerise leaving a latent print residue with a stable ridge impression.
- *Physical developer* uses a special silver-based solution to enhance latent prints by reacting with the lipid components (fatty acid); reaction involving silver ions and an oxidation/reduction reaction involving iron salts.

**Visualisation of Latent Prints**
- *Alternate light source* (“ALS”): special high intensity light sources with filters to control the wavelength.

**Special Conditions**
- *Bloody fingerprints* 
- Use of blood enhancement reagents such as phenolphtalin, leucomalachite green, tetramethylbenzidine (causes peroxidase reaction with the hemoglobin portion of the blood). 
- Use of general protein staining dyes like *Amido Black* and *Coomassie Blue*.

- *Fingerprints deposited on sticky tape* 
- Use of crystal violet that stains skin cells trapped by the sticky surface with a deep violet colour. 
- Sticky side powder: use of lycopodium pollen in a detergent solution that will adhere to the skin cells making them visible.

-  *Human skin* 
- Extremely difficult to lift latent prints from human body 
- One way is to use super glue fuming and then enhance with black powder

### Identification and Comparison
- Number of points required for identification: *the 12-point rule.* 
- Singapore Police Force previously required *16 points* match before calling two fingerprints a match. 
- International Association for Identification (“IAI”): current practice is that no minimum number of matched points required for an identification

- Automated Fingerprint Identification System (“AFIS”): computer storage and retrieval systems for fingerprints were originally developed for law enforcement agencies.
- Computer hardware and software for image processing and storage: ability to search the database rapidly for a match.
- After a computer match, the fingerprint expert should then compare the retrieved print and the questioned print.
