## Question 1
If all the links in the Internet were to provide reliable delivery service, would the TCP reliable delivery service be redundant? Why or why not?

No, packets might still be lost or stuck in a loop when nodes transmit data wrongly. 
- out of order packets due to nodes

## Question 2

a) 110

b) 011

c) 011

d) 110

## Question 3
a)
0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0

b)
1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0

c) as long as int the sides of the rectangle
1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0

## Question 4
There are many nodes in a shared medium network and most nodes are likely to transmit frequently. Which of the following multiple access protocol(s) is (are) suitable?

TDMA and Token Passing
A lot of collisions for CSMA which can make throughput quite low
TDMA is useful as all nodes are transmitting frequently
Token Passing is better in time but less pragmatic as a token has to be passed around



## Question 5
a) t = 244 bit time

b) b starts at 244 bit time
signal arrives a A t = 245 + 244 = 489
A's transmission time is 64 * 8 = 512 > 489
