# Relational Model & Relational Algebra

### Superkey
a) Possible superkeys of R include:
- {A, B, C, D}
- {A, B}
- {A, C}
- {A, D}
- {B, C}
- {B, D}
- {C, D}
- {A}
- {B}
- {C}
- {D}

Why cant it be a tuple of 3 items i.e. {A, B, C}

b) The possible candidate keys of R given that {A,C} is definately a superkey is only {A, C} since it is a minimal superkey

c) Only {A, C}
