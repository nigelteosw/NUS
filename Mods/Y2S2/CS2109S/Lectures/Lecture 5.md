# Linear Regression

## Midterm
- 1 question on search and setup the problem
	- Similar to PS1
	- Eventually need to write the code to answer the problem
	- Articulate the answer without writing code in the exam (intention)

- 1 question A star search
	- What is consistent and admissible
	- Revision of 1231
	- Proof Question

- 1 question on alpha-beta pruning
	- Do the website left to right, right to left
	- Know where is pruned #revise

- 1 question on decision given data what is the tree
	- The formula for IG and remainder #revise
	- pruning for min sample: every leaf must have at least n items


## Types of Supervised Learning

### Regression
- Predict results within a continuous output, map input variables to some continuous function
	- Speech recognition


### Classification
- Predict results in a discrete output, map input variables into discrete categories
	- Fraud detection
	- Spam filtering


### Inductive learning method
- Curve fitting
- deduce the function f
- using the mean squared error function
