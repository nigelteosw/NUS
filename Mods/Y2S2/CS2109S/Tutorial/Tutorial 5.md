# Classification, Logistic Regression and Performance measures

### Q1.
#### a)
TP = 8
FP = 1
FN = 1
TN = 10

#### b) 
Precision = 0.8889
Recall = 0.8889
F1 score = 0.8889

#### c) 


#### d) 
p = 0.5

#### e)
In such cases, the focus should be on maximizing recall instead. By increasing recall, the model will be better at detecting all true positive cases, including those that are harder to detect or that have low prevalence. This may help to reduce the risk of missing important cases, and can lead to earlier detection and treatment of tumors.

#### f)
Maximizing precision is important when false positives are costly or can have serious consequences, such as damaging the reputation of innocent individuals or leading to legal action. Therefore, if the goal is to minimize false positives, then maximizing precision should be the priority.


### Q2.
#### a)
Cuteness and fluffiness

#### b)


### Q3.
#### a)
