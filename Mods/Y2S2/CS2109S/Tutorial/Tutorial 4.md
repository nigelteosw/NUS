# Decision Trees and Linear Models

### Qn 1 Decisions That Matter
#### a)
Credit History splits into approve and reject.

#### b)


### Qn 2 Linear Regression Model Fitting
With bias: 
`(3.999999999995639, array([[-5.5],[-7. ],[ 7. ]]))`
or 
`4 - 5.5x - 7x^2 + 7x^3`
Without bias:
`[[-1.31818182], [-4.09090909], [ 4.09090909]]`

### Qn 3 Examining Cost Functions
#### a)
The use of mean squared error causes with squared differences means that large errors are penalized more heavily than small errors because the differences are squared. From the graph there are quite a few outliers on a dataset with data following a line.

Using mean absolute error means that outliers are less impactful.


#### b)
