# Didier Anzieu and The Skin Ego

## Key Ideas:
- The Skin Ego sets out to explain how the biological skin of Laplanche’s non-technical definition of the ego, the living individual, takes on a symbolic function in the formation of the ego.
- differentiate between inner and outer reality
	- the skin surface is based on the biological bedrock model and the skin ego is propped up by this;
	- that the surface yields internal and external sensations
	- communication which eventually develops into a semiotics derives from direct skin-to-skin contact
- The skin performs ‘a primary means of communicating with others, of establishing signifying relations an inscribing surface for the marks left by others’
- materialistic look at the skin
	- self and the ego is envelopled with the bodily sense
- mind and body are one
- using the word skin: the skin ego is a mental correspondent of skin, skin as an interraction of touch (leakage)
- Not well written - can be explained in simpler terms
