# Penetrations

## Changing body perceptions
- Wounds and bloody discharges from the skin
- Skin is the primary danger zone of possible penetration and infection
	- Contact with water problematic
- Anatomy introduced as a subject to artists
- Opening of corpses deemed as a medical affair
	- substitutes for real organs were used (wax models)
	- started the exploration of the lymphatic and neural network
- Skin was only seen as a two-dimensional surface
- Surface of the skin was not yet regarded as a smooth wall but as a three-dimensional layer interwoven with the world.
