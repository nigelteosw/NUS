# Skin Laid Bare

## Key Ideas:
- Skin provides information, sensing
- Skin as protection from the environement


## What is [[Skin]]?
- Made up for different layers with physical and chemical properties
- Shields us from environmental oxidants, heat and UV radiation
- Skin can become thicker to be a better protector
- Contains hair

	- Piloerectionâ€”literally, raising of the hairs. Piloerection occurs when an animal is angry, frightened, or thrilled and serves to make the animal look larger and more threatening
