# Emotions, Sex, and [[Skin]]

## Key Ideas:
- Skin acts as a sensor for our body
- Skin can evoke responses such as "cold sweat" when the nervous system is stimulated
	- Emotional sweating has played a significant role in the arena of forensic science. This type of sweating betrays the mood state of nervous anxiety, even at its most subtle level. Polygraph test can be used on skin.
- Skin can change color e.g blushing
	- Reddening of the face during extreme anger is a highly conspicuous sign of a powerful negative emotion
	- associated with both extreme anger and embarrassment
- females have more swelling than others
	- It turns out that, in this instance, bigger is genuinely better, in terms of reproductive success and evolution.
	- Large sexual swellings are an example of what zoologists refer to as an “honest signal,” a reliable indication of evolutionary value that is physiologically costly to produce but that yields results in terms of enhanced reproductive success.
- skin is also intimately involved in sexual activity
	- sexually aroused, their skin becomes flushed, usually around the neck and chest
	- Caressing, stroking, or lightly brushing these erogenous zones increases sexual pleasure and arousal.
	- Our skin also reacts when we’re thinking about sex or talking about it. Many such reactions are socially conditioned: when a culture treats sex as a sensitive or taboo subject, some people have a difficult time talking about it, and their faces turn red with embarrassment when they are forced to do so. They even turn red when they see animals having sex
