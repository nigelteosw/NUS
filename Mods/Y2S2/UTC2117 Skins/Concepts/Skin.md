### Outline
Skin is the outer covering of the body in mammals, composed of multiple layers of cells that provide a barrier against the external environment. It protects the body from damage, helps regulate body temperature, and plays a role in sensation, such as touch and temperature sensation. It also contains specialized cells such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and oil glands that serve various functions. The skin also contains pigment cells called melanocytes that give skin its color.

### Sensors
Human skin contains a vast network of nerves, including sympathetic nerve fibers, which belong to the autonomic nervous system.1 The job of this system is to maintain the body’s internal environment by controlling such “automatic” functions as breathing, circulation, and digestion.

### Color
Flushing in response to anger and blushing in response to embarrassment are fascinating phenomena, though not well understood. These reactions are generally confined to the face, especially the cheeks, forehead, and ears, because the arteries in these areas have an enhanced ability to dilate, or widen, and thus increase blood flow

Skin color changes can occur due to a variety of reasons. The most common cause is exposure to sunlight, which can cause the skin to darken or tan. This is a result of the skin producing more melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color, as a protective response to UV radiation.

Other causes of skin color changes include hormonal changes, certain medications, and certain medical conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo. In addition, the skin color can change due to injury or inflammation, and it can also be a symptom of certain skin cancers.

Certain genetic conditions can also cause skin color changes, such as albinism and pigmentation disorders, where a person may have inherited a deficiency or excess of melanin.

### Sex
The skin is the largest sexual organ of the human body, although we don’t usually think of it as such. Much of the pleasure of sexual intimacy comes from the exquisite expectation of touch and the delight and relief of skin-to-skin contact with another person.
