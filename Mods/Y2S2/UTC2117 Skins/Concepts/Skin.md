Skin is the outer covering of the body in mammals, composed of multiple layers of cells that provide a barrier against the external environment. It protects the body from damage, helps regulate body temperature, and plays a role in sensation, such as touch and temperature sensation. It also contains specialized cells such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and oil glands that serve various functions. The skin also contains pigment cells called melanocytes that give skin its color.
