### Activity 2: Self-ethnography
I think the biggest impact that my skin has had on me is the stress eczema that I get from stress. I've always had it from young but I thought that it was just occasional infection on my hands until I started noticing a pattern. During periods of stress, I would experience skin peeling, itchyness and sometimes blisters. It was extremely annoying as during the A levels or times of exam, I needed to use my hands to write and my eczema which acted up made it difficult for me to hold a pen. I actually made a conscious effort not to show my hands to my friends as it looked disgusting, which someone commented before. It was really bad as I would also be stressed that my hands and feet were not getting better and that creates a negative feedback loop of more stress on top of an already stressful period in time. After a visit to the doctor I was diagnosed with chronic Dyshidrotic eczema, which is a specific type of eczema that commonly manifests as small, intensely itchy blisters on the hands, as well as feet and he told me that one of the dyshidrotic eczema's main triggers is stress. When I went back to tell my mum that she was kind of skeptical as she does not believe its due to stress, cause which parents wants to think that their child is under pressure in life. I believe that it does not affect me as much now as I have better learnt how to manage stress as well as making sure my hands are dry and moisturized. Sometimes I do get hints that its coming back like one or two blisters may form but I will learn how to take a step back from it all. In a way it is good that I notice this trend as even though I myself may tell myself that I am not stressed out and that I can manage it, my hands would tell another story. So there is a relationship between the mind and the skin that exists, even if we try to reject what the skin is telling us.
