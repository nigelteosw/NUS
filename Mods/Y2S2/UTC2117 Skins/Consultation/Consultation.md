### Initial Q and A

do you care about your feet?

yes i do. before that, she realizes that your hands and feet are ugly "need to cut". Need to maintain that part of the body (grooming). Part of your appearance at this point. Neutral to footwear that shoes toes, not self conscious about others looking at toes. 2 times for pedicures. Dryness of the feet. Using lotion on feet. Never sold feet.

Why only 2 times?
Why only recently?
Someone else pointed that out (social impact)
- What people do with their skin then they realize how their person sees their skin and how they modify it
- Social influence and social gaze
- What people say and what they do, care about feet skin but look at their skin in reality

What importance do u give your feet
- Aesthetically 
- Beauty concern 
- Health concern

How do u look after your feet.

## Potential Directions
1.  Why do you think foot skin is often overlooked in our skincare routines, despite being crucial to our overall health and well-being?
2.  How do cultural and societal beauty standards influence the way we perceive foot skin? Are there any cultural differences in the way people approach foot care?
3.  How does the appearance and health of our foot skin affect our self-confidence and body image?
4.  How does the footwear we choose to wear impact the health and appearance of our foot skin? Do you think we should prioritize comfort over fashion when it comes to our shoes? (climbing shoes have to be tight)
5.  Do you think the beauty industry's focus on perfection and flawlessness has contributed to the rise of foot skin problems, such as foot fungus and ingrown toenails, that are often stigmatized and considered taboo? 

1,2,3 can combine
