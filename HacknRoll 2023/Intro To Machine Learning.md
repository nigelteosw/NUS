1. Supervised Learning
	- Task Driven (Classification/Regression)
2. Unsupervised Learning
	- Data Driven (Clustering)
3. Reinforcement Learning
	- Learning from mistakes (Playing Games)


## K-fold Cross-validation
- Training Data and Test Data is used
	- Test data is used to test if the model is accurate


## Training and Prediction
- Underfitting and Overfitting
	- Underfitting happens when the model did not learn enough
	- Overfitting when the model is learnt too well (adds additional noise)


## Neural Network
- Many hidden layers
- LSTM (long-short-term memory)
- GRU (gated recurrent unit)
- Many components
	- sigmoid
	- tanh
	- pointwise multiplication
	- pointwise addition
	- vector concatenation
